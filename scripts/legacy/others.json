    "Thinking out loud about Phoenix, Real Estate, and Phoenix Real Estate - a Chris Butterworth site\nTuesday, February 12, 2008\nHow many houses should I see before making an offer?\nMy historical answer (as politically correct as it may be) has been \"as many as it takes.\" I've worked with enough buyers to know that people are inherently different; some will buy the first house they see, while others will look at homes for months, or even years, before they're ready to make the move. But that's ok ��� I've always strived to give top-level service, regardless of how long it takes.\nI figure that over the long haul it all balances out, and I end up with lots of happy clients. I've even assumed that the clients I worked with for a long time would appreciate my service that much more, since I didn't do as much to help my shorter-term clients find their home.\nThat may not be the case. I've spent some time reviewing my business, looking at where my referrals have come from, and what type of client referred them. Turns out a significantly higher percentage of my referrals come from clients who picked out a home on the first or second time we went out looking.\nWhat does this mean? Maybe these clients are happier & more decisive in general, and more apt to make a referral. Maybe the longer my clients work with me, the less they like me (although I hope this isn't the case!) Maybe the more homes a client looks at, the more overwhelmed they become, and ultimately the less happy they are with the entire process. I think there's some validity to this last point..\nBarry Schwartz wrote a book in 2004 called The Paradox of Choice: Why More is Less. In it he talks about the overwhelming amount of choice exhausting our brains, ultimately restricting instead of freeing us. 900 cable channels but nothing good on tv? Easy fit, relaxed fit, and loose fit jeans, but none of them fit right? I think Schwartz's theory is currently being acted out in our over-supplied real estate market.\nTim Ferris wrote an excellent piece on this same topic last week (which actually started me down the road of analyzing my own business.) He went to Barnes and Noble to exchange a book ��� a five minute errand, right? 30 minutes later, feeling completely overwhelmed, he left the store with the same book he had originally brought in!\nHow many houses should you see before making an offer? As many as it takes to find one you love. However, if you can convince yourself to buy the first one you love, at a reasonable price, odds are you'll be happier than if you force yourself to see all 100 homes available in your area before making a decision.\nFood for thought, anyway.\nYour occasionally falls victim to paralysis by analysis Realtor,\nChris Butterworth\n[tags] inventory, Tim Ferris, Why More is Less, Fletcher Heights [/tags]",

    "OCTOBER 6, 2018\nEricsson eyes Indycar move\nMarcus Ericsson has admitted his next move could be out of formula one and into Indycar.\nThe Swede has been signed up to stay at Sauber next year as reserve driver, but he is quoted by Brazil's Globo as indicating he also wants to keep racing.\n\"We're also talking to teams in other categories,\" said the 28-year-old.\n\"I see myself returning to formula one in the future, and in order to be able to, I want to continue to race in fast single seater cars. Indy is the best championship to do that,\" Ericsson added.\nHe said Formula E is not a major consideration.\n\"It's definitely one of the options and interesting in many ways, but it may not be the best to stay in the type of racing as formula one. Formula E is more of a career move.\n\"There are some better options to keep you on the radar to return here,\" said Ericsson.\n(GMM)",

    "The demographics of the most popular social networking sites are changing quickly and, once again, the team at Flowtown has done a great job of compiling the latest statistics about Facebook users and social network usage in general. Did you know that the average age of a Facebook user is 38 years old? Even more interesting is that 61% of Facebook users are now older than 38 ��� the company has come a long way since first launching exclusively to an audience of college students.\nAnd what about Twitter? The average Twitter user is 39, and 64% of tweeters are 35 or older.\nAnother interesting statistic found in the data is that social media users who are 18 to 29 use social networks almost as much as they use e-mail; other reports have recently suggested that users under 18 use social networks more than e-mail.\nCheck out all the details below!",

    "The 123rd episode of our 12 Questions segment features producer Giddyhead.\n1. If you had to pick one track which solidified your love for electronic music early on what would it be?\nNo particular one, might be from VHS tapes, ambient music from films and surf videos from the 80���s.\n2. What was your first and last DJ gig?\nNot long ago, July 2011. The last one was November 27 at the presentation of Inti Burn, the community around Burning Man in Argentina. It will take place in a valley in April 2015.\n3. What was the first and last record you purchased?\nThe first one was Loco Live ��� The Ramones and the last one was Permiso ��� Jose Larralde.\n4. What would you say is the highlight of your career thus far?\nIn 2012, played by Hernan Cattaneo for the first time can be a highlight. Or a feedback from Sigur Ros by email about my remix. It reads: ���hey cesar, thanks for the mail! thanks for taking the time to make the remix and glad its getting recognition! darren. sigur-ros.co.uk��� Hernan has drawn a smile on my face several times, Sigur Ros are so amazing and you might guess my feeling. My first release: ���Constanza (Eight Degrees South)��� and the support of Lee Burridge, a personal highlight, if you know what I mean.\nBasically is a lot of work and everything has its own moment or characteristic of importance in different ways. Some time ago when I had the chance to remix the cover of ���Pale Blue Eyes��� recorded by Moby and Julie Mintz(from his own Pro Tools session)and sending to her the different demos to finally read: I love both (Julie Mintz) but Moby said that the second one is the best. I realized that I was getting a feedback from Moby and as if it wasn���t enough Darrell Thorp supported the track, a 3 times Grammy Award winning, the man behind Radiohead, Atoms For Peace, Beck and many more, I cannot describe that moment.\nI mean, is all about love.\n5. Tell us something about yourself that might surprise people?\n2011-Groove Armada-Red Light remix competition- Andy Cato said this about my remix: ���The change at 3.39 is lovely. The classic major/minor thing that in this context works really well. The remix has been approached from a really musical angle. I���m not sure you need the extra part that appears initally at 0.46 and then again at 4.13. It takes up a lot of space in the middle, and holds back the roll a bit. The opening would make a fantastic drop. I think you could go between that and the 3.39 change initially without the original bass part, just those lovely chords from the opening. Then the second time around, a bit of extra top end and the filtered original bassline. There you would have a peak time Sasha tune.���\n6. Who are some of the best undiscovered talents in your eyes?\nThe last undiscovered talent I met was a lady from Buenos Aires, she doesn���t look worry about being recognized as a new talent so I will just say her real name, I hope she don���t mind. We (a small group of friends) were sharing a few days in a Estancia in the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Devorah plays a n���goni and sing. We share some influences from Indu, African and World Music, who knows maybe we meet someday to make a collab. I was shocked by her mixture of styles and my feeling was.. this is something like Sigur Ros and Amadou & Mariam, hard to explain but a very strong feeling of conciousness and love.\n7. Which producers consistently inspire you?\nI always take a care listening to different djs and producers like Ricardo Villalobos, Lee Burridge, Guy Gerber, Steve Bug and others. Now with ��me, Matthias Meyer, Gardens Of God, Gab Rhome, YokoO and others we have great artists on the go.\n8. What artist or track would you love to remix? and who would you love to be remixed by?\nI would love to remix to Tom Waits and I would love to be remixed by Matthew Dekay.\n9. Record labels are a dime a dozen these days, which ones if any standout for you?\nDer Dritte Raum, Cocoon, Ellum, Cadenza, Warp Records, Innervisions, All Day I Dream, microCastle, Hot Creations, SudBeat, Maeve, Last Night On Earth, liebe*detail. On the other hand, labels like Sound Avenue, Agara Music and many others which takes new artists on scene have also an important role.\n10. What would you say is the best mix compilation of all time?\nI don���t feel confortable saying what���s the best but the first time I was listening to Perfecto and I met with the voice of ���You are sleeping��� was love on first sight, but Renaissance, Global Underground, Sven Vath stuff. Every work done by these people has a huge impact, Hernan, Sasha, Sven, Nick Warren, Diggers, they have all gave a Master Class.\n11. Current Favourites (you can list more than one per category if you like)\nFood: Gluten Free (No choice)\nDrink: The Glenlivet 12 Year Old\nDrug: Whatever you do, don���t tell anyone\nAnimal: Perry, my dog\nTV Show: Pensado���s Place\nMovie: The Wall\nVideo Game: No I don���t\nAlbum: Hail To The Thief\nTrack / Song: Two Dots\nProducer / Band: Edward Kennedy ���Duke��� Ellington\nRecord Label: Mute ��� All Day I Dream\nNightclub: Kristal Glam Club ��� Warung\nDJ: Lee Burridge ��� Hernan Cattaneo ��� Ricardo Villalobos ��� Danny Howells\n12. If the final DJ/live set of your career was next week what would your last track be?\nQuilla ��� A Million Broken Bikes (Ricardo Villalobos & Shaun Reeves Remix)\nGiddyhead���s remix of Ozgur Ozkan ���Cholera Street��� is out now on Agara Music, you can purchase the release: here",

The mountains of delectable gelato ��� hazlenut, lemon, strawberry, coconut, banana.. endless flavours for endless orders of triple scoop waffle cones. Seeing the Statue of David at literally every single tourist location and then seeing the real thing at the Galleria dell���Accademia. Its historic buildings and quirky touches. Not to mention the Floretine roofscape! Those terra cotta tiles that seem to cover every single building in Florence. I just couldn���t get over how pretty Florence was not just from ground level, but also from above. One of the highlights from my trip was climbing the hundreds of steps up to Piazzale Michelangelo (where once again, we saw another David). The view of Florence from Piazzale Michelangelo was unsurpassed. There was a busker singing acoustic love songs in front of the beautiful panoramic backdrop of Florence and there was literally so much romance in the air that I almost expected to see someone be proposed to! The entire vibe of the city was one that was laid back and local. It was such an enchanting place to stay and a stop not to be missed. It was really Italy at its best.\n������ 15.03.13 | outfit\n, travel\n������",

    "Your Tenancy\nYour tenancy agreement is an important legal document\nIt details your rights and responsibilities as our tenant and our rights and responsibilities as your landlord.\nAll tenancies are unique in terms of dates and who is listed on the tenancy, so please make sure you have read and understood your personal tenancy agreement as it will be this individual document which will have your specific information on it.\nThe headings on this page contain general information which applies to all customers.\nIf you have a specific query about your tenancy, or cannot find your tenancy agreement and would like to request a copy, please Contact Us.\nIf you are looking to end a tenancy, please expand the \"Ending A Tenancy\" heading.\nWe're making your tenancy more secure!\nWe���re in the process of converting over 800 Probationary and Fixed Term Affordable Rent Tenancies into Lifetime Tenancies.\nThis means if you live in an Affordable Tenancy home (properties that have been capped at the level to be no more than 80% of local market rent), we���ll be asking you to sign a new tenancy agreement for a lifetime tenancy (this ensures the customer holding the lifetime tenancy has the right to stay in the property for as long as they are alive).\nWhy are we doing this?\nAffordable Rent Tenancies were originally introduced in the form of Fixed Term Tenancies (a tenancy lasting 5 or 10 years). Some customers were worried about losing their homes at the end of the fixed period and there have been occasions with mutual exchanges where applicants have refused to exchange due to lack of security. We have looked at current legislation and terms of the Tenancy Agreements and it is now agreed that we are able to grant Affordable Rent Tenancies on a Lifetime Tenancy. These are periodic tenancies running from month to month with no end date.\nAll our new Affordable Rent Tenancies will be either probationary or Lifetime, with the probationary ones automatically converting to lifetime.\nWe do however have some historical tenancies that are still on Fixed Term and we will be contacting these customers to convert their tenancies so none of our customers are at a disadvantage.\nOur dedicated team are working through the process and will be calling customers affected to support you through this by helping you sign the new tenancy agreement through Adobe Sign digitally where possible.\nChanges you need to tell us about\nIt is important that you let us know if your or your joint tenant's circumstances or contact details change.\nFor example, if:\n- you change your name through marriage or divorce\n- you want to add or remove someone from your tenancy\n- a joint tenant leaves the property\nYou need to let us know so that we can update your tenancy.\nIn addition, if your contact details change you also need to let us know as soon as possible. This is important in case we need to contact you in an emergency - for example, if you or a neighbour have a burst pipe we may need to get in touch with you without you being aware that a repair is needed.\nIf possible, please provide us with a telephone or mobile number for emergencies, and an email address so that we can contact you with less urgent news in an unobtrusive way.\nEnding A Tenancy\nIf you are leaving your property:\nYou must give us written notice to end your tenancy. You can give us notice by completing our Customer Notice to Quit Form (using Adobe Sign).\nYour tenancy agreement will say how much notice you need to give. It will be either four weeks ending on a Sunday or one calendar month.\nBefore you move on we need to remind you about a few things you need to do to make sure the house is left clear and in a good condition. For more information please view our Property Condition Leaflet [pdf] 2MB.\nGas Safety When Moving House\nWhen moving house you have a legal obligation to make sure your former home is in a gas safe condition. Gas appliances must be disconnected and removed safely by a Gas Safe engineer. You can find a Gas Safe engineer by clicking here.\nFor more information please download our Gas Safety Information Leaflet [pdf] 30KB. For help and advice please call us on 0333 200 7304.\nEnding A Tenancy On Another's Behalf:\nIn the unfortunately event that you need to end a tenancy because one of our customers has died, gone into care, or any other reason then there is a legal process we have to follow.\nWe understand this can be an incredibly difficult time, but please let us know as soon as possible by filling out our Notice To Quit On Behalf Of A Customer form (using Adobe Sign). If you need advice you can also call us on 0333 200 7304 and we will do whatever we can to support you.\nWe can only accept notice if you are the next of kin or are legally acting on behalf of the tenant - for example if you are the executor of their will, have been appointed an administrator by the Probate Office or have power of attorney. You can find out more about this and what you need to do on the gov.uk website.\nWe will ask you to provide confirmation that you have the legal right to end the tenancy. If there is no executor or administrator, we have to serve notice on the Public Trustee to end the tenancy.\nRight to Buy\nFollowing a recent Government announcement for an extension of the Right to Buy scheme, Platform Housing Group have not been provided with any further information at this time.

It provides a non-stick surface that not only reduces the number of cleaning cycles required during the paste printing process, but also improves paste transfer efficiency for very small openings. Upon application, the less than 5 nanometer coating bonds with the stencil foil at the microscopic level and will not alter the stencil opening size or foil thickness. Nano coating is an industry proven process which shows immediate and measurable improvement from the first print and can even be applied to previously used stencils.

    "STAFF WRITER\nBERLIN - With its most difficult part of the schedule ahead of it, the Berlin football team appears to be hitting its stride at just the right time.\nThe Redcoats played perhaps their most complete game of the season last Friday against Tolland. Led by quarterback Kevin Dunn, who accounted for five total touchdowns - four in the air and one on the ground - Berlin (7-0) rallied past the Eagles 41-10.\nBut will that be enough for tonight���s opponent?\n���We���re going into Bloomfield full force,��� running back James Mazzarella said. ���We���re putting everything we got into this game because we want to show teams who we are as Berlin.���\n���We have to play to our full potential,��� offensive linemen Dominic Lattarulo said. ���Based on previous weeks, we���ve overcome a lot of adversity on the field but this is our biggest test this year.���\nThe Warhawks have only one loss, a Week 2 24-16 loss to now 13th-ranked Rocky Hill, and Bloomfield���s offense, which averages 36 points a game, will present the Redcoats with their toughest challenge yet.\nBloomfield relies on junior Ky���juon Butler as its primary running back. Butler has amassed 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns on just 122 carries this season, averaging 9.8 yards per carry. And while he is one of the major focal points of the Warhawks��� offense, the team also has sophomore running back Anthony Simpson, who has rushed the ball 45 times for 454 yards (10.1 yards per carry) and has 10 total touchdowns.\nBut Bloomfield has shown it is capable of throwing the ball as well. The Warhawks��� freshman quarterback, Daron Bryden, has also made quite an entrance himself, completing 69.2 percent of his passes for 1,197 yards and 15 touchdowns to just five interceptions.\nBerlin head coach Joe Aresimowicz is uncertain how his team is going to play the ball tonight. Depending on what Bloomfield brings to the field, determines the Redcoats��� pace of play.\n���[It���s going to depend] on what their defense is giving us,��� Aresimowicz said. ���It puts our defense in a big spot.���\nPerhaps the most important aspect for the Redcoats tonight will be how well they play collectively as a unit on each side of the ball. Earlier in the season, one of Berlin���s issues were players not communicating effectively on the field. As such, the Redcoats stopped using reward decals on their helmets as a way to put more emphasis on team play instead of focusing on the individual.\n���They bought in,��� Aresimowicz said. ���Not only did we stop handing them out, but they took them all off their helmets. They bought into the team aspect.���\nAnd that could be the difference between a win and a loss not only for tonight, but moving forward as well.\n���We���re actually playing as a team and you can tell by the scores of the last three games,��� Mazzarella said. ���People have been saying Tolland was supposed to be our biggest game, but right now these last three [Bloomfield, Rocky Hill and New Britain] are the toughest games of our schedule and we really just need to come together, focus every single day at practice and show these teams what we have.���",
    "A week after her oldest daughter tested positive for the coronavirus, Jennifer Santana and four other members of her family received a positive test.\nThe Buford family has been quarantining for more than three weeks, and Santana said returning to work might not happen until the middle of August.\n���We went to get tested and it came out we were all negative. We didn���t think anything of it. Give or take about a week later after testing, like half of us came out positive,��� she said.\nThat included Santana, her husband, two of her daughters and a daughter-in-law.\nSantana described three days of more serious symptoms of high fever, nausea, back pain, trouble breathing and muscle pain that gradually faded.\nQuarantining has meant everybody staying in their rooms and only coming out with masks on, but the time away from work has caused strain on their finances and food.\nSantana said they were lucky to have some money saved but were thankful for a recent food drop-off facilitated by Hispanic Alliance GA.\n���I don���t know what we would have done,��� she said.\nVanesa Sarazua, executive director of Hispanic Alliance GA, discussed another man who had been in the hospital for months.\n\"He unfortunately has fallen behind on his rent, has fallen behind on his utilities, has lost his car, so we see those consequences of being sick and afflicted with this illness and how it has a long-term effect really on families and on poverty,��� she said. ���It really sets them back. Even if after they're able to recover, it'll take a while for them to be able to go back to work and have a normal life.\"\nSarazua said they served 550 families in a food drive-thru Saturday, July 11. They have also served anywhere from 30 to 75 families a week with food boxes being dropped off to families either sick, quarantining or without transportation.\n\"Now, pretty much it's more a reality for a lot of people where they know someone who has been sick, either in their family or at work or their friends. It's a more of a reality, and they see the seriousness of it a little bit more in our community,��� Sarazua said.\nA question-and-answer session with Dr. Antonio Rios had roughly 3,000 views on Facebook Live, the third installment of conversations with health officials for the community.\nRios, chief physician executive for Northeast Georgia Physicians Group, said the questions have been: When will the vaccine be available? What does the antibody test mean? Are masks helpful?\n\"What we're telling people is don't get your hopes too high on the antibody test, because it may mean you had it, but it may not be an insurance for you to just ignore all of our measures. We're still trying to message heavily to social distance, to wear masks, to wash hands, to avoid going to gatherings and things like that,��� Rios said.\nNortheast Georgia Health System provided data in April showing 49% of COVID-19 cases from Hall County are Latino. In April, 30% of cases were identified as Latino across the entire NGHS service area.\nHall County Breakdown of Positive Cases\n49% - Hispanic/Latino\n35% - White/Caucasian\n10% - Other/Unknown\n5% - African American/Black\nSource: NGHS\nService Area Breakdown of Positive Cases\n31% - Hispanic/Latino\n47% - White/Caucasian\n16% - Other/Unknown\n6% - African American/Black\nSource: NGHS\nThose numbers have not moved in three months. Data provided Tuesday, July 14, had 49% of Hall County���s cases being Latino and 31% across the entire NGHS service area.\nAccording to 2019 census estimates, 29% of Hall County is considered Latino.\nRios said he felt that the testing facilities have been ���saturated��� to the point where there is a delayed turnover in getting results.\n\"It's still here. It's not going away. You need to be really careful,��� Rios said.\nIn terms of recent trends, Rios said there has been an increase in those 18-40 who have been hospitalized.\nThe Times previously reported on how the poultry industry was tackling the best ways to prevent spread of the virus through various safety measures\n\"What we've seen is that the poultry industry is no longer a common denominator, and there hasn't been a single industry right now that really is highlighted as to where patients are working,��� Rios said.\nBetween Thursday, July 16, and Friday, July 17, the number of patients in the intensive care unit jumped from 16 to 31. The number of confirmed COVID-19 positive patients being treated also rose from 88 Thursday to 106 on Friday.\nThe hospital has not had more than 100 confirmed patients being treated since May 14, according to its online data.\nWith the opening of schools around the corner, Sarazua said she feels there will be a need for masks, hand sanitizer and other supplies.",

    "Thursday, 2 May 2013\nSavoury Flapjacks\nWell I can only urge you to put your prejudices aside and read on.\nThese flapjacks might better be called 'Cheesy Flapjacks' (does that sound any more appetising?!) and the recipe is taken from the brilliant 'Baby Led Weaning Cookbook' by Gill Rapley. I tend to make a half-sized batch of these, but as Ted is beginning to eat more and more (and I love to snack on them too) I think I'll start making the full amount. They are really useful portable snacks for babies, but if you don't have children to feed then please don't ignore this recipe, they're delicious for all ages!\nSavoury Flapjacks\n100g butter ( preferably unsalted if cooking for young children)\n300g porridge oats\n350g grated cheese (I usually use mature cheddar, but used 50% red leicester in my most recent batch which gave them an attractive orangey colour)\n2 beaten eggs\n200-300g of one of any of the following (grated): carrot, courgette red onion, sweet potato, swede or parsnip (the veg is an optional addition, but I usually grate in whatever veg I have in the fridge, just to make them extra-nutritious).\nPreheat oven to 180 and lightly grease a Swiss roll tin (for a half-batch I use my 20x20cm silicon pan).\nMelt butter in a pan over a low heat. Take off the heat and combine all ingredients in the pan, mixing well.\nPress down into the tin using the back of a spoon or fork. Bake for 20 minutes until golden brown (I usually find they need an extra 5-10 minutes, but that might just be my oven, or my own personal preference).\nAllow to cool for 5 minutes then cut into slices and turn out onto a wire rack (although if I've cooked mine in a silicon tray I let them cool in that before turning them out onto a wooden board and cutting them into slices).\nAnd my harshest food critic? He approves! Success.\n5 comments:\n- snowy said...\n-\nThese sound really interesting Kate. We love flapjacks, and there's always some left over veg lurking in the fridge.\n- 3 May 2013 14:29\n- nipitinthebud said...\n-\nmmmm they sound worth trying. I'll expect to see pics of Ted helping out next time {wink}\n- 4 May 2013 11:53\n-\n-\ncan't wait to try these!\n- 3 July 2013 14:58\n- Mama Melons said...\n-\nJust made a batch of these for all the picnics planned in this glorious weather. They look perfect. I also added poppy seeds. Thanks for posting the recipe.\n- 8 July 2013 11:39\n-\n-\nThanks for posting this, I was looking for it. I add thyme or parsley too, because my Mr 9 Months loves stronger flavours (curried egg mayonnaise, hummus with harissa, sag paneer!)\n- 27 December 2013 18:06",
    "today i���m posting a tutorial for skirting the issue, a campaign by liz and elizabeth of simple simon & co. to donate at least 100 skirts to girls in foster care by the beginning of august. i���m so happy to join in the effort!\nthe simons asked a bunch of bloggers to create simple skirt tutorials to share and inspire others to sew for this great cause (or anytime, really). since my little gal is only 4, my first thought was little gal skirts. a skirt is the first thing i sewed for her when she was just 15 months old, and remains a favorite thing to sew. my tutorial today is pretty simple, but it���s got some fun style. i���m also sharing a few general skirt making tips i���ve picked up over the past few years.\nfor the design, i was inspired by fruits ��� citrus, berries, and melons ��� the type of summertime fruit that my sisters and i sat outside and snacked on as kids, juice running everywhere, until we decided the best way to clean off was to run through the sprinkler. well���all but the lime, which was probably adding some flavor to mom ���s icy cold beverage as she kept an eye on us.\ni created an abstract color blocked skirt that gave me that summery feeling. i���m calling it the fruit stripe skirt!\nwe���ve got citrus in sizes 3T and 2T���\n���and melon and a berry varieties in sizes 4T and 18 months!\nthe colors are interchangeable; once you know the method, you can make your skirts in whatever style you���d like. best of all, these take very little time and require no hemming! let���s get sewing.\nMATERIALS\n- three cuts of fabric ��� you can make them fruitlike, like mine, or just pick any fun color/print combo in your stash. depending on your size you���ll need about 1/4 yd for the rind (green/yellow part), less than 1/4 yd for the pith (white part), and about 1/2 yd for the fruit (pink part). scraps work well here ��� use what you have!\n- for the seedy skirts: fabric paint (i used black for the watermelon and metallic gold for the strawberry), regular pencil with intact eraser, x-acto knife\n- 3/4��� elastic for the waistband\n- safety pin, water soluble marker, and a clothespin\nTUTORIAL ��� printing the seeds\ni thought it���d be fun to add seeds to the strawberry and watermelon skirts for a little extra dimension, so i���ll start with a quick how-to on those.\ntrim a teardrop shape out of your eraser with your x-acto knife. dip it in some fabric paint (i like to use a scrap of freezer paper as my paint palette ��� i dab off excess and practice on the paper before stamping the fabric). start stamping in a random pattern, with the point of the teardrop facing up. allow to dry, then heat-set with an iron.\nTUTORIAL ��� sewing the skirt\nseam allowances are 1/2��� unless otherwise specified\ni prefer to cut toddler/preschooler skirts selvage to selvage and have just one seam in the back, but if you need to cut two pieces like i did on a couple of these, that works too ��� you���ll just have side seams. just make sure all fabric widths are exactly the same ��� even if you cut the strips selvedge to selvedge they may differ slightly, so square them up and trim them all to match.\nyou���ll lose about 2��� of the pink fruit stripe to waistband and seam allowance, so for a 13��� finished skirt (4T), cut a 12��� pink (fruit) strip. add or subtract an inch per size larger/smaller (so for the fruit strip, cut 11��� for a 3T or 14��� for a 5). no matter the skirt size, i cut all of my cream strips at 2��� and my rind strips at 5��� (aside from the two-color strawberry, where i cut just a 6��� rind piece). finished, the cream stripe will be 1��� + 2��� green rind + 10��� pink fruit = 13��� 4T skirt.\nsew the short ends of each of the colors right sides together, so you have three tubes.\npress the rind seam allowance open. for the pith and fruit, serge to finish the seam allowances or trim to 1/4��� and zigzag. if serging, feed each new strip right in after the last to save time. press finished seams to the side.\nslide the pith tube over the bottom of the fruit, matching seams. here i like to ���bisect and pin.��� pin at the side seams, then pull both layers taut. align edges and pin in the center. then hold at a side seam and the center pin taught, and put a pin in the middle. repeat for the other side, working around the skirt until you���ve pinned all the way. this distributes any extra fullness along the entire skirt rather than starting to pin on one side and finding out you were off somewhere along the other end (it also works great for knit neckline binding).\nsew, then finish, then press toward the darker fabric (here it���s the fruit).\nfold your rind in half lengthwise wrong sides together, and press so your raw edges align.\nslide the rind over the skirt, aligning the seams and pinning the raw edges as you did with the pith to the fruit. sew, then finish. press toward the rind.\nthis is what your skirt will look like from the right side and wrong side.\neither serge the raw top edge or fold under 1/4��� then another 1 1/2.��� press and pin. i like to use a green and red pin along the center back to mark where to leave the gap for my elastic. sew at 1 1/4��� (just within the serge seam), leaving about a 1.5��� gap in the center for the elastic. i also like to stitch about 1/8��� all the way around the top waistband to prevent the elastic from twisting.\ncut a length of elastic to size (child���s waist measurement), then shape into a circle like it will sit in the skirt and mark arrows at each end with a water soluble pen. the parts at the edges of the arrows extend upward and will help you align them later. attach a safety pin to one end, and a clothespin to the other. feed the elastic through the gap using the safety pin ��� the clothespin will prevent you from losing the tail on the other end. when you get back to the gap, remove the pins and match up your arrows, making sure they haven���t twisted. overlap the elastic about 3/4��� and sew a square in it to secure, then spread out the waistband so it retreats up in there.\ninsert a ribbon or size tag into the gap, then sew closed. distribute the fullness toward the back of the skirt.\nyou���re DONE! fresh and fun and ready for summer! with no hemming, these really are very quick to make. if you make a skirt using this tutorial, please add it to the skirt as top flickr group!\nif you make any skirts to donate to foster care, be sure to add them to the skirting the issue flickr group for your chance to win prizes (as well as the general ���warm fuzzies��� you get for doing a good deed)!\nhere are a few foster care agencies in the portland area for those looking to donate (thanks to kat for helping find these!):\nplease call first to make sure you���ve got the proper address before sending your skirts; i didn���t verify them and we want our skirts going to the right place! some also have specific donation wishlists for you to consider.\nhappy sewing, all you do-gooders!",

    "It can be very hard to find texts that reinforce the vocabulary you are learning and are not too difficult and frustrating. – this is the problem that Rosetta Stone ‘Stories’ solves.\nRosetta Stone ‘Stories’ are a carefully curated selection of texts about the country and culture of the language you are learning. ‘Stories’ come in different levels appropriate to where you are in your learning programme: you can always find a text that you can understand and learn from.\n‘Stories’ are both audio and text files. As you listen, the text being read out is highlighted (just like a Karaoke machine), so that you know exactly where you are in the text at all times.\n‘Stories’ are all about the culture and places relevant to the language you are learning. Find out about the famous landmarks, the routines and practises of the people, and their personal stories.\nFor example, if you are learning British English, ‘Stories’ will tell about the Tower of London in very simple language for Unit 1 learners: “The Tower of London is white and the sky is blue.”\nOnce you have progressed as far Unit 10 (mid-way through your Rosetta Stone programme), you can read about having afternoon tea, using slightly more complex constructions: “Tea is good for you, and most people in England drink one or two cups of tea a day”.\nGet to the your final class with Rosetta Stone and you should be ready to read about ‘The Street Party’, a personal story about a young girl called Rosie: “Rosie lived in Leytonstone, in the east of London, and later in the day, she and her neighbours were having a party for everyone who lived in their street”.\nOr if you are learning German, you can learn all about Nymphenburg Palace in Munich in Unit 2, when you’re just a beginner. Listen to a radio interview with a football player in Unit 7, when you’re a bit more advanced. And then listen to a very informative story of a lady visiting Cologne Cathedral in Unit 19.\nIn total there are around 30 to 50 different ‘Stories’ to work through per language: A rich resource at your disposal whenever you have a spare moment.\n‘Stories’ acts like a Karaoke machine, highlighting words as they are read out to you. In addition, many of the words in the texts are coloured green. When you hover over these words with your mouse, pictures pop up to explain the meaning of the word. (Pictures from the units you have been learning).\n‘Stories’ can all be downloaded onto your mobile device, so that you can listen to them wherever you go.

    "EAST TEXAS (KYTX) -- Millions of Americans have used electronic cigarettes. Advocates say they're a safe and effective alternative to cigarettes, but as Susan McGinnis reports, the Food and Drug Administration says e-cigarettes may be hazardous to your health.\nJustin King enjoys a puff on his lunch break.

He's using electronic cigarettes which he says helped kick his 18-year addiction.\n\"I wasn't feeling good, I was overweight, I was smoking two packs of cigarettes a day,\" he said.\nE-Cigarettes are battery operated device; some of which turn nicotine into a vapor that is inhaled instead of smoke.\nA recent study in Italy found e-cigarettes helped smokers cut the number of cigarettes they smoked in half. And many kicked the habit completely.\n\"I think it could be a revolutionary tool from a public health perspective.\"\nBut not everyone is convinced.

    "The goal of Listening to Parents is to eliminate the unnecessary barriers that prevent qualified, loving parents from adopting children in foster care. Each year, a quarter of a million prospective parents will approach child welfare agencies to learn about adopting a child from foster care. Too many will find these agencies to be unresponsive, bureaucratic, and unwelcoming. Many will give up in frustration. Waiting children will wonder why “no one wants me”. The parents who want to adopt will wonder, “Why is it so hard to adopt?” There is no irony more tragic in America. Fact: There are far more people wanting to adopt children from foster care than there are children in need of families:\n- Joint research by Harvard University and the Urban Institute documented that in any given year, 240,000 Americans will call for information about adopting a child from foster care. Only a tiny fraction of these prospective parents, less than 4%, will actually adopt a child from foster care.\n- According to the most recent National Survey of Family Growth, 600,000 American women were actively trying to adopt a child. The overwhelming number were interested in adopting a child that fit the profile of those in foster care. For every black child in foster care there are 12 prospective parents actively trying to adopt who would be willing to adopt a black child. For every child between 6 and 12 years of age, there are 8 prospective parents. For every child 13 years and older, there are 6 prospective parents.\nDespite the documented fact that there are far more parents wanting to adopt than children available, each year, 30,000 children age out of foster care leaving foster care at 18 with no family, no resources and, all too often, no future.\nCollaborating with child welfare leaders and experts from around the country, Listening to Parents works to eliminate the barriers that prevent children in need of families from being adopted by the families that want to adopt them.\nChange is possible. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 was designed to double the number of children adopted from foster care within five years. The skeptics were wrong. It took only three years to double the number of children adopted from foster care each year, from 25,000 to over 50,000.\nWe can create that kind of change again. Please join us.",

    "1¢ Statue of Columbus Stamp\nNot long after the U.S. issued overprinted stamps for use in Cuba, new stamps were designed and printed by the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The first of these stamps pictures a statue of Columbus, who first discovered the islands in 1492 and named them for the ancient town of Cuba in Beja, Portugal.\nFew of these scarce Cuba stamps still exist. Over time these stamps may become even more difficult to find, so order now.\nFew U.S. Cuba Overprint Stamps Survive!\nWhen the U.S. Battleship Maine mysteriously exploded after being sent to Cuba to protect Americans caught in Cuba’s war for independence, Spain was blamed. Soon after, war was declared and America took administrative control of Cuba as well as Guam, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. The United States established a military government to run Cuba from 1898 until 1902, when the nation’s first president was elected.\nAlthough many native Cubans were angered by U.S. policies, social conditions improved a great deal during the American occupation. Most important was the effort led by Dr. Walter Reed to combat the deadly “yellow fever.”\nAs an emergency measure in 1899, U.S. stamps were overprinted for use in Cuba. The overprinted stamps included the 1894 Bureau issues and the Series of 1898-99, stamps that were commonly available at that time. Shortly after, the emerging republic issued engraved pictorial stamps with distinctly Cuban themes that included Christopher Columbus, royal palms, and ocean liners.\nTwo years later, Cuba drafted its own constitution and U.S. military administration in Cuba ended in 1902 with the formation of the Republic of Cuba. In less than four years, Spain’s colonization of the Caribbean and Philippines had ended, and the United States emerged as a world leader.\nU.S. Places Embargo On Cuban Goods\nOn October 19, 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the first embargo on Cuba.\nThe U.S. and Cuba have had a long and tumultuous shared history. The Spanish first settled Cuba in 1511. Colonists grew sugar cane and tobacco on large plantations, relying on the forced labor of native peoples.\nCuba’s Spanish settlers became increasingly dissatisfied with Spain’s rule and many revolutionary groups were formed. By the mid-1800s, many Cubans and Americans favored making Cuba part of the United States. The U.S. government made several attempts to buy Cuba from Spain, but Spain refused them.\nThe Cubans eventually took up arms against the Spanish due to a lack of political power and rising taxes. By the late 1800s, many Americans wanted to intervene in the conflict. Following the explosion of the American battleship Maine in Havana Harbor, the U.S. officially declared war on Spain. By August 1898, the Spanish surrendered. The U.S. emerged as a world power and gained the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands.\nAfter the Spanish-American War, the U.S. established a military government in Cuba. Cuba adopted a constitution in 1901. The constitution contained provisions called the Platt Amendment, which allowed the U.S. to intervene in Cuban affairs. It also allowed the U.S. to buy or lease land for naval bases in Cuba. In 1903, the U.S. received a permanent lease to build a naval base on Guantánamo Bay.\nOver the next 50 years, Cuba was in a state of unrest, with new governments forming and frequent revolts by and against Fulgencio Batista. Among those opposed to Batista’s dictatorship was Fidel Castro. Castro circulated a petition calling for deposing the illegal Batista government. This proved ineffective.\nOn July 26, 1953, Castro attempted to start a revolution by leading an attack on the Moncada Army Barracks in Santiago de Cuba. This proved disastrous. Castro and many of his followers were imprisoned. Castro was released from prison in 1955. He formed the 26th of July Movement, a revolutionary group named after the date of his first revolt. Castro took his group to Mexico, where they could organize safely.\nIn December 1956, Castro’s forces landed in eastern Cuba. Most of Castro’s rebels were quickly killed – but Castro and 11 others managed to escape into the Sierra Maestra Mountains. From the mountains they waged a guerrilla war against the Batista government.\nBatista’s increasingly unpopular dictatorship provided fertile ground for Castro’s 26th of July Movement. The dictator’s attempts to neutralize Castro and his men made the rebels more popular with the people. By mid-1958, public support for Batista was crumbling. On January 1, 1959, Batista fled Cuba.\nCastro’s forces quickly took control of the country. The old government was dismantled – many former political officials and military officers were executed. By mid-February, Castro was sworn in as prime minister. The U.S. supported Castro’s government… until American-owned properties in Cuba were seized. Relations declined sharply.\nIn the spring of 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower approved a plan to embargo sugar, oil and guns. Then in June, U.S. oil companies refused to refine oil in Cuba that had been delivered by the Soviet Union. Eisenhower then cut the Cuban sugar quota by 95 percent. None of this deterred Castro, who continued to nationalize American business and commercial properties. As a result, President Eisenhower enacted a trade embargo against Cuba on October 19, 1960.\nEisenhower’s embargo outlawed all U.S. exports to Cuba except medicine and some food. President Kennedy later expanded the embargo to include all U.S. imports from Cuba.\nOn April 16, 1961, Castro declared Cuba a socialist state. A one-party Communist system was established. Castro pursued a close relationship with the Soviet Union and enacted many Soviet-styled, state-controlled agricultural and industrial “reforms.” The Soviet Union contributed a great deal of financial aid to Cuba – the nation’s economy grew very dependent upon this assistance.\nAs “the revolution” grew more radical, large numbers of Cubans fled their country. Once exiled in America, many of these exiles worked to undermine Castro’s regime. In 1959, a group of anti-Castro exiles even hired U.S. planes and flew over Cuba, dropping leaflets and small firebombs.\nIn the coming years, the Bay of Pigs Invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis placed the nation in the international spotlight as people all over the world nervously anticipated nuclear war. Finally, the U.S.S.R. agreed to remove the missiles. In return, the U.S. promised not to attack Cuba. Defiant as ever, Castro protested this decision to the Soviets. Although the missiles were removed, thousands of Soviet troops remained in Cuba.\nDuring the late 1980s, the Soviet Union and its satellite nations in Eastern Europe began to ease their political and economic restrictions. Castro criticized these efforts. In 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist – the end of an era in world history. This meant an end to Soviet financial aid to Cuba, worth about $4-5 billion a year. However, Castro declared Cuba would remain Communist.\nCuba’s economy was further damaged by increased economic restrictions from the U.S., enacted in 1992 and 1996. In response, Castro loosened some restrictions on the economy and allowed many Cubans to leave the country. Investment, especially in tourism, from Canada, Europe, and Latin America has enabled Cuba to stage a modest economic recovery. Perhaps the most progressive of Castro’s new policies is the opening of “free trade zones,” where companies are allowed to import and export goods without seeking permission from the government.\nOn July 31, 2006, Fidel Castro underwent surgery and had to assign presidential power to his brother, Raúl Castro, temporarily. Though his health reportedly improved somewhat after surgery, Fidel Castro decided to officially resign from the presidency in 2008 – his brother replaced him.\nDuring his time as president of Cuba, Raúl Castro has implemented many economic reforms – some even reversing laws put in place by his brother. One of the biggest achievements Raúl Castro has made was in December 2014 when he and U.S. President Barack Obama negotiated renewed diplomacy between the United States and Cuba. The two countries officially returned to full diplomatic relations on July 20, 2015. On March 20, 2016, President Obama was the first sitting U.S. President to visit Cuba in 88 years.\nIn the summer of 2016, relations between the United States and Cuba slowly improved. U.S. President Barack Obama has continued to urge Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba. Meanwhile, embassies in both countries have re-opened, and all signs point to relations continuing to improve.",

    "When director Zack Synder's reimagining of George Romero's watershed zombie epic Dawn of the Dead (1978) was announced, no amount of outrage in the horror community was spared. How could Romero's independent, unrated splatter classic (this was the very film, in fact, that Romero coined the term 'splatter movie' for) possibly be translated into an R-rated studio film? Even worse, this atrocity was going to be helmed by a music video director who had never directed a feature film - and it was scripted by James Gunn, who at the time was known mostly as the writer from the godawful live-action Scooby-Doo. If there was ever a film that had fandom united in anticipation of impending suckitude, the Dawn of the Dead remake was it. To call it a hard sell to the horror crowd doesn't even cover the amount of animosity that Dawn of the Dead '04 had to overcome.\nAnd that's why this trailer is one of the all-time greats - because it immediately turned the tide of opinion on this movie. What had been the target of nothing but 'fuck this movie' diatribes suddenly was looking pretty sweet.

    "Scottish Terriers have small, compact, sturdy frames covered in coarse, wiry, weatherproof coats that usually come in black, brindle or wheaten colors. Their long heads have full muzzles, square jaws, pointy ears and widely set eyes. Their intense stare has often been called “varminty.” Scotties have thick necks that slope down to short, cobby bodies with broad chests and short but powerful legs. Their thick, tapered tails are usually carried high.\nSporty and playful, Scottish Terriers bring a high-spirited energy to any household. Perfectly at home in apartments, houses or grand estates, Scotties have a distinctive charm that can be both amusing and bewildering at the same time. They are a proud breed, full of happiness, dignity and toughness. Most of all, they love companionship—give your Scottie plenty of that, and it will be your ever-loving pal.\nDon’t be fooled by their size: Scotties make terrific watchdogs. In fact, you’d be hard pressed to find a more formidable little scrapper. Protective and fearless when their environments are threatened, they also know when to show restraint. They are somewhat reserved with people outside the family circle—some might even call them aloof—but as long as they are properly introduced to new friends they will be perfectly charming.\nScotties need exercise, attention and activity to stay physically and mentally sharp. If you leave them in the back yard for hours at a time, you’re asking for trouble: Scottish Terriers love to dig. And when they’re bored, they can get up to all sorts of other mischief. Make sure your Scottie gets plenty of walks, including special times off the leash in a controlled environment.\nA healthy Scottish Terrier can live as long as 15 years. Common health issues include epilepsy and von Willebrand disease (a prolonged bleeding disorder). They are also susceptible to something called “Scottie Cramp,” when the muscles randomly lock up. This usually occurs during exercise and can last for a few minutes.\nScotties need to be brushed regularly. During shedding seasons, they should be brushed daily (at least). Scottish Terriers need to be professionally groomed several times a year.\nBred long and low to follow foxes, rabbits and badgers into their dens, the Scottish Terrier either dates from the 19th century or the 15th century depending on who’s doing the talking. For many years, various terriers including the Skye and Yorkshire were lumped into the “Scottish Terrier” category, angering some purists. To set matters straight, the Scottish Terrier Clubs of England and Scotland were formed in the early 1880s. Today, the Scottish Terrier—along with the West Highland—are considered the oldest of the Highland Terriers.",
    "Excerpt from \"Safer Birth in a Barn?\" Midwifery Today, Issue 83\nposted with permission\nThe protocols in the world of animal husbandry to protect an offspring at the time of birth—no strangers, dimmed lights, freedom of movement, familiar environment, unlimited nourishment, respectful quiet, no disruptions—are done without hesitation because to do otherwise invites \"unexplained distress\" or sudden demise of the offspring. These thoughtful conditions are the norm, along with careful observation to determine when to use the technological expertise in true emergencies. When we have veterinarians in our childbirth education classes, they always start to smile and nod when I tell this story. These are givens—instinctive givens, even, for animals of all descriptions!\nYet what are the \"givens\" for the human who births not in a barn, but in a \"modern and advanced\" hospital? In many cases, 100% the opposite! Usually a minimum of a dozen strangers pass through the world of the laboring mother in her first 12 hours in the hospital—security officer, patient transporter, triage secretary, admission clerk, triage nurse, resident and/or doctor on call, admitting nurse, first shift nurse, break nurse, additional nurse at delivery, doctor or midwife plus possibly students, anesthesiologist, pediatrician, etc. Bright lights in the triage and labor rooms are challenging to dim. Mothers are tethered to monitors or IV poles and are moved through a bright hall with unfamiliar sounds to a new room in a building devoted to illness/trauma that most have visited once briefly if at all. They receive poor quality \"clear liquids only.\" They are exposed to voices of others in the hall or chatting by the attendants during contractions and endless disruptions throughout! But then, do we ever find that we have an offspring experience \"unexplained distress?\" Of course, and at frightening rates! Yet, oddly, many of these disruptions are promoted as minor inconveniences or necessary to \"protect\" the baby.\nCuriously, while veterinarians commonly have to defend interventions in light of the additional cost and the risks associated with interfering with nature, providers caring for human mothers within the medical system more commonly are forced to defend why they did NOT intervene! Consider the high rates of inductions, epidurals, artificial rupture of membranes, immediate cord cutting, cesareans and the vigorous defense necessary to fight for anything different, especially if time is involved (time to go into labor, to progress, to push, to allow the cord to stop pulsation or to get \"done\" bonding). I've recently seen outstanding CNMs and obstetricians sacrifice their own political reputations and suffer departmental reprimands for births with great outcomes where they protected the mothers' yearning for privacy, allowed extended pushing time with great vital signs or, during a healthy normal birth, followed their intuition and honored the mother's begging to check heart tones frequently by hand during pushing instead of what the mother considered the massive intrusion of wearing the monitor belt. Interventions are considered to be the ultimate protection from litigation in human care, yet they contribute mightily to the high rates of distress in mothers and babies!\nIn animal husbandry, the first line of defense for protecting the unborn is to protect and nurture the nutritional needs and comfort of the birthing female. In the case of institutionalized birth for humans, however, in spite of evidence to the contrary, the norm is to act as if the nutritional needs and the comfort of the birthing mothers are of concern to, at most, the marketing and public relations department! It's an affront to common sense that as a society we are currently more accepting of the needs of foaling mares, whelping poodles and high-producing cows than of our birthing humans. From the high rates of fetal distress, meconium staining and breastfeeding problems, the consequences are clearly devastating to our infants, just as any decent horseman would predict.\n\"I'd take birthing in a barn over birthing in a hospital any day...\"\nPosted by Creeping Starfish on Jul 6, 2008",
    "New Chapter Day! [This post has been found in violation of H.R. 3261 S.O.P.A. and has been removed]January 18, 2012\nThe new chapter is ready. It would have gone up today, but instead, it will be released tomorrow so I can add just one small voice to the SOPA Blackout in progress at Wikipedia, Reddit, and other sites trying to spread awareness of the “Stop Online Piracy Act” or SOPA bill which the US Congress will vote on next week.\nThe bill is superficially about copyright protection and intellectual property. It sounds plausible, movies are big business. I’m as worried as anyone about the disproportionate amount of power corporations have gained over US lawmakers, but I think we can all agree that if Warner Brothers is spending upwards of $100,000,000 on The Dark Knight Rises, it’s not unreasonable for them to ask us $10 a head to watch it rather than having anyone able to download it for free.\nBUT this legislation that is allegedly about pirated movies and TV shows has provisions to snuff out any website, arrest those who even maintain a site that LINKS to objectionable content, and essentially impose China-modeled controls over the Internet in the United States. This proposed legislation also seems to have surfaced immediately after WikiLeaks.\nThere is a history in this country of a government that cannot go after people for one thing – like, say, protesting the war in Vietnam – finding a way to go after them for something else that many of them do – like, say, smoking marijuana.\nThere is no social site out there where people are forwarding a Huffington Post article about Ron Paul where somebody isn’t also sharing a YouTube from The Brave and the Bold cartoon. There is no blog network where somebody hasn’t posted a still photo from Twilight made into a faux motivational poster about Edward being the lovespawn of Dracula and Tinkerbell.\nANY SOCIAL NETWORK and ANY WEBSITE can be shut down under SOPA, and a case can be made against any one of us. This is an attack on free speech in the one medium left that corporations cannot control, where this little gal writing a fan fiction series can shout just as loud as Time Warner, and where the merits of each view decides who the audience will go back to, not the advertising budget behind it.\nWhether you are political or not, like Cat-Tales or not, whatever it is you want to say online, this is a time to call your Congressman and tell them to oppose SOPA. Because whatever other positions they hold, it doesn’t make much difference if they give on this one. This is the dealbreaker, folks. This is the one that snuffs out our ability to talk about all the others.\nSOPA is not about copyright or piracy. It is about censorship and free speech. Use it loose it, guys. Use it or lose it.",
    "Ford B-Max vs. Fiat 500L, I know you are not very familiar with this type of article in this space. But time-to-time, I want to share my opinions with you.\nFord B-Max and Fiat 500L are the small family MPVs. Ford B-Max offers more conservative design with sliding rear doors and Fiat 500L is the Fiat 500 with steroids. In my opinion, Fiat 500L has a better design in both exterior and interior than the Ford B-Max. But this does not mean that Ford B-Max does not look good, it also does! Especially the sliding rear doors are very practical for tight parking spaces and loading items to rear seats.\nWhat I perceive from these two cars, Fiat 500L is more fashionable small family MPV for families whom do not wish to vanish their sense of fashion due to their larger family. On the other hand, Ford B-Max is designed for practicality more than fashion sense. It is definitely for families whose primary concern is the practicality!\nBoth Ford and Fiat are in similar price range in many market however, due to taxation for different engines size you may see difference prices.\nFord B-Max offers petrol engines of 1.4-lt 90 HP, 1-lt Turbo EcoBoost 100 / 120 HP and 1.6-lt 105 HP for PowerShift automatic gearbox. Diesel are; 1.5-lt 75 HP and 1.6-lt 95 HP. Except 1.6-lt petrol engine rest of the range is offered with 5-speed manual. This is the only disadvantage of Ford B-Max, limited automatic gearbox option and 5-speed manual.\nFiat 500L offers petrol engines of 1.4-lt 95 HP and 0.9-lt 105 HP. Diesels are 1.3-lt 85 and 1.6-lt 105 HP. Automatic gearbox is offered only with 1.3-lt diesel engine and the rest is 6-speed manual.",
    "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration recommends some pre-work stretching and flex exercises to help reduce injuries. Stretching helps reduce musculoskeletal disorders and muscle-related discomfort, according to OH&S, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration's online magazine.\nStretching Your Back\nFor back stretches, stand with your feet spread apart and put your hands on your hips. Slowly bend backward until you start to feel a bit of tension, then hold this position for five seconds. Lean back forward, relax for five seconds, then repeat.\nReturn to your starting position, but place your arms down to your sides. Reach one hand up above your head at a time and gradually lean to the other side and stretch for five seconds. Return again to the starting position and repeat with your other arm.\nStretch out your thighs by lifting your right leg up behind you and holding your ankle with your right hand. Use your arm to pull up on your ankle and stretch your thigh. Balance yourself by holding your left arm out to the side or holding onto something stable. Release your right leg, then repeat with the other side.\nStretch your hamstrings by placing your left foot on a bucket that stands around 12 inches. With that leg straight on the bucket, gradually bend at the hip until you start to feel some tension. Hold this position for five seconds, then switch and do the right side.\nUpper Body Stretches\nStretch your shoulders and chest by sticking your arms out to your side, then bend your elbows until your fingers are pointing toward the ceiling. Gently pull your arms back, squeezing your shoulder blades together. Hold this for five seconds, relax for five seconds, and then repeat.\nFor forearm stretches, begin by holding your arms out straight in front of your body. Face your palms down, make a loose fist, then gently bend your fist down and rotate your wrist. Hold your fist in this position for five seconds, relax for five seconds, and then repeat.\nTaking short breaks from what you're doing can also be helpful and decrease work injuries, according to OSHA. Doing your job can sometimes cause you to stay in awkward positions for excessive periods of time, which can lead to wear and tear or localized fatigue. When you're doing an activity continuously, whether it's at your desk or out in the field, try to take short breaks, switch to other positions or try to do other tasks to work different muscles groups while allowing those you've been using to rest.",

A 2008 study by the University of Arizona found up to 99% of fecal pathogens transfer easily onto clean floors inside the home via shoes. Fecal coliform and other bacteria found in dog waste can make people sick, leading to breathing problems, diarrhea, blindness and worse. Some of the diseases that can be spread to humans from pet waste include,\n- Campylobacteriosis (a bacterial infection frequently causing diarrhea in humans)\n- Salmonellosis (the most common bacterial infection transmitted to humans -- symptoms include fever, muscle aches, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea)\n- Toxocarisis (roundworms transmitted from animals to humans. Symptoms include vision loss, rash, fever, or cough)\n- Fecal coliform causes dysentery, hepatitis, typhoid fever and ear infections\n- Roundworm, giardiasis, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis and cryptosporidiosis\n- Cysticercosis which is a disease of humans involving larval tapeworms in the human body\nWith 1.2 million dogs in the greater Dallas, Texas area, that’s the sewage equivalent of a city almost as large as Dallas with no toilets. DFW dogs produce some 900,000 pounds of sewage per day which contaminating the environment, especially groundwater, area lakes and the Trinity River.\nVolunteers from Texas Stream Team working with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) conduct monthly tests to monitor water quality of the White Rock Lake watershed which feeds directly into the Trinity. TCEQ standards for water quality include a maximum of 126 colony forming units (CFUs) of E. Coli bacteria which come from warm-blooded animals such as humans, dogs, and coyotes. Some of the prime tributaries feeding the lake include White Rock Creek, Skillman Branch Creek, Williamson Creek, and the Dixon Branch Creek. All of them are toxic with E. Coli.\nDog waste is not “fertilizer”\nSome people assume dog waste is okay for composting but the EPA says NO! unless you like flowers and vegetables impreganated with toxic bacteria. Eating a tomato with fecal bacteria inside of it is about the same as sprinkling dog waste in your cereal = not recommended. Composting does not kill the smorgasbord of harmful pathogens in dog waste that attack humans and pets. Fecal coliform bacteria are just one of a whole suite of pathogens that can thrive in a compost pile and wind up inside \"bacteria-bomb\" vegetables!\nIgnoring the above-ground sewage in your backyard is going the way of bloodletting and other harmful practices held over from darker, less enlightened times.

    "Rising air pollution is easily one of the biggest challenges that China is facing today. A U.S. report published this year stated that around 4,000 people were dying every day in China due to air pollution. This problem becomes even worse during the winter season when the Chinese start burning coal to heat their homes. In addition, industrial pollution and carbon emissions from motor vehicles add further to rising air pollution levels in the world’s most populous country.\nThe Chinese city of Shenyang has been one of the hardest hit, where the quality of air has now reached beyond hazardous levels. On Sunday, the level of poisonous airborne particles (known as PM 2.5) in Shenyang was almost 500 times more than the normal limit of 25. In fact, the pollution levels recorded in Shenyang on Sunday November 8, 2015 were the highest ever recorded in China since the country started monitoring its air quality in the year 2013. There is little doubt that China now needs to find innovative ways to fight its growing air pollution problem.\nAn Innovative Solution To This Problem\nThe hydrogen fuel cell is a device that produces electricity and water by consuming hydrogen through an electrochemical (and a pollution free) process. With its growing air quality issues and rising demand for public transportation, hydrogen fuel cell tech could find many takers in China. Related: Venezuela Liquidating Assets As Economic Crisis Worsens\nMost of us have already heard of popular fuel cell vehicles like Toyota Myrai, but few know about the fuel cell powered railway engines and trams that exist today. In an interesting recent development, China’s Tangshan Railway Vehicle Co (TRC) and Canada’s Ballard Power Systems signed a $2.2 million definitive agreement on November 1 to create fuel cell-powered Trams. The two companies are planning to introduce a prototype by next year that would be powered by a 200kw fuel cell manufactured by Ballard Power Systems, which would have an estimated operating lifetime of 20,000 hours.\nHow expensive is fuel cell technology for rail transport?\nHydrogen fuel cell technology could be quite suited for the rail industry as it has the potential to replace the massive cost of setting up of new electric railway lines (that cost around $12 million per mile n U.S.) and replacing the CO2 emitting diesel engines. However, the cost of hydrogen fuel cells and the cost of setting up hydrogen refueling stations at every stop are two very important considerations. With the average cost of hydrogen fuel cells being around $1,000 per kilowatt of generated power, the initial cost of setting up a ‘Hydrail’ network could be pretty high. Related: Oman Calls OPEC To Action, Doesn’t Buy Saudis Strategy Anymore\nHowever, despite these obstacles, the fuel cell market is growing at a rather impressive pace.\nIn 2014, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that, with the shipment of around 50,000 fuel cells, the market for hydrogen fuel cells almost doubled to $2.2 billion. With the potential of completely removing the high manufacturing costs of conventional rail transport lines along with reduced emission levels, we could witness a global adoption of this technology in the coming decade. It needs to be noted that companies like Alstom, Bombardier, ABB, Siemens, Mitsubishi, Toshiba and Hitachi have already shown interest in producing engines powered by fuel cell technology.\nHow drastic would the reduction in emissions be?\n“The environmental advantage of hydrogen at the point of use is significant compared to diesel, as only water is emitted as exhaust gas, providing significantly lower well-to-wheel GHG emissions than both diesel and electric power in many countries,\" said Andreas Hoffritcher of University of Birmingham. Related: How Shale Oil Will Survive The Crude Carnage\nImage Source: RailFreightPortal\n(Click to enlarge)\nTrains produce significantly less CO2 emissions when compared to vehicles. Also, a hydrogen powered train or a tram would produce water and around 6.85 grams of greenhouse gases per mega joule of LHV when compared to 22 pounds of GHG from one gallon of gasoline, thereby significantly reducing overall emission levels.\nWith rising demand for public transportation, the (possible) introduction of fuel cell trams by TRC in the near future could be a major step by China towards tackling its rising pollution levels. However, a lot depends upon the performance of its prototype.\nBy Gaurav Agnihotri of Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\n- IEA Thinks An Oil Price Rebound Is A Distant Possibility\n- Argentina Pulling Ahead In The Race To Be The World’s Next Shale Hotspot\n- The Middle East Could Face A Historic Crisis By Century’s End",
    "Ven. Santussika Bhikkhuni\nA couple of weeks ago, the American Association for the Advancement of Science issued a report intended to dispel the fog of disinformation about the reality of climate change and to impress on us the urgency of taking action. What we need to know is what we ourselves can do about it.\nOne day, when I was talking about the importance of taking immediate action on climate change, a good friend of mine said, “I just wish the scientists would get together and tell us whether they think climate change is happening.” Well, my friend, there is a paper I want you to see.\nThe American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world’s largest general scientific society, has issued a report entitled “What We Know” that should clear away any residue of doubt. The report states:\nSo let us be clear: Based on well-established evidence, about 97% of climate scientists conclude humans are changing the climate. This widespread agreement is documented not by a single study but by a converging stream of evidence over the past two decades from polls of scientists, content analyses of peer-reviewed literature and from public statements issued by virtually every expert scientific membership organization on this topic. The evidence is overwhelming: levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are rising. Temperatures are going up. Springs are arriving earlier. Ice sheets are melting. Sea level is rising. The patterns of rainfall and drought are changing. Heat waves are getting worse as is extreme precipitation. The oceans are acidifying.\nThey point out that the consensus among climate scientists that humans are changing the climate is as strong as that among health experts that smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease. What they didn’t say in the report is that the same tactics that were used to keep the public in doubt about the risks of smoking are now being used to sow doubt about climate change and its primary cause, the burning of fossil fuels. The film Gasland II discloses that the fracking industry has even employed the very same advertising agency that came up with the idea of introducing doubt as a way to preserve the profitability of the tobacco industry.\nThe report emphasizes that Americans are already experiencing the effects of climate change. It is happening here; it is happening now; the impacts around the globe affect us all.\nLast year the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere broke the 400 parts-per-million mark, an increase of 120 ppm over pre-industrial levels. This rise in CO2 levels is causing widespread impacts that will only become worse. They include changes to our global landscape as ice melts, fires rage, and sea levels rise; changes in animal behaviors and increased rates of species extinction; deaths caused by heat and extreme weather events; the increase of heat-related illnesses; contamination of drinking water; and increased challenges for national security.\nThe report warns that the longer we take to reduce CO2 emissions, the greater the risk that we could experience “abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes that have massively disruptive and large-scale impacts.” Some of these potential irreversible changes include large-scale ice sheet collapse in Greenland and the Antarctic, collapse of part of the Gulf Stream, dieback of the Amazon rainforest, coral reef die-off, destabilization of sea floor methane, and the release of large amounts of CO2 from the thawing Arctic permafrost. The possible large-scale impacts include the collapse of ecosystems and “rates of extinction [that] are likely to place our era among a handful of severe biodiversity crises in the Earth’s geological record.”\nYou might ask at this point, “How will this affect me?”\nAs Earth’s systems collapse, so do our sources of food and water and all other necessities for life. This is already being felt in some places on the planet. If run-away climate change becomes a reality, we are likely to experience massive loss of human life and the crumbling of civilization. It’s not a pretty picture. Even though the chances that some of these outcomes occur may be relatively small, the consequences would be very grave. So, the report makes the case for sensible risk management, the kind many of us use on a regular basis, like fire insurance or seat belts and airbags. The chances of our house burning down or of us getting into an auto accident aren’t so high, but we take out fire insurance and use seat belts as a precaution. In this case, the insurance premiums are lower and the coverage is much better if we act as soon as possible. As the report says, “The sooner we take action, the more options we will have to reduce risk and limit the human and economic cost of climate change.”\nThe final section of the report is entitled “There is much we can do.” I found this part to be characteristically disappointing. Even though the authors may have felt that a concrete list of actions was not appropriate to include, I would beg to differ. To take in the reality of climate change is a pretty tough thing to do, but when we do take it in, we’ve got to roll up our sleeves and take action. For this, we need specifics. Here are some of my recommendations:\n- Review a few sources to be sure you know the facts on climate change and how to “live in climate truth.” Besides the AAAS report , I recommend the “Do the Math Movie” by 350.org and the article by Margaret Klein called “Our Society Is Living a Massive Lie About the Threat of Climate Change — It’s Time to Wake Up.”\n- Talk with friends, families, coworkers, and members of the organizations you belong to about the facts of climate change and the solutions we need to implement. Help mobilize them.\n- Join together with others to meet officials at all levels of government to secure their commitments to push policies forward to make the necessary changes.\n- Make sure that all investments are fossil-fuel free. Divest your own interests from fossil fuels and work to get organizations you are associated with (universities, churches, pension plans, etc.) to do the same.\n- Participate in actions organized by 350.org, the Sierra Club, and others that are resisting fossil fuel extraction, production, and use.\n- Speak out against and resist all forms of extreme fossil fuel extraction: fracking, deep-sea drilling, mountain-top removal, tar sands, and drilling in the Arctic.\n- Write letters to the President, the State Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, and any other government agencies with a mission to protect the people and interests of the nation.\n- Take every opportunity to reduce the use of fossil fuels and to recycle and reuse goods.\nNow that we have no doubt about the reality of climate change and the importance of immediate action, this is our chance to make a real difference and rise above whatever might hold us back from fully embracing life as it is now, here on planet Earth, working to restore our prospects for a bright future.",
    "Cloud App Integration-Developers Should Know\nCloud integration refers to a combination of tools, technologies, and practices that companies can use to connect applications, systems, data, and even the entire IT environment. Such integration can occur between different providers and cloud platforms, as well as between hosted and local resources or on location.\nThe emergence of public cloud computing has enabled companies to use a variety of resources and services that are highly measurable on demand rather than building and maintaining them in-house. However, in some organizations, the arrival of these various resources and services has created an IT silo because admins struggle to manage and maintain each of the different resources or cloud data sets.\nFor example, it is relatively easy for a business to use a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application to integrate new employees and make relevant payroll and tax records. But new employees also have to accept new email accounts, such as for Office 365, as well as access to relevant collaboration tools. New employees must also be added to the organization’s Active Directory (AD) database.\nWithout cloud integration, IT needs to do all these integration tasks separately and manually – a time-consuming process and increase the chance for errors. Through data and service integration, however, IT can use policies and processes to automatically implement many of these tasks.\nThe main purpose of cloud integration is to connect different elements of various cloud and local resources into one ubiquitous environment where an organization can more easily access and manage applications, data, services and systems.\nTypes of cloud integration\nThe IT team can implement various types of cloud integration, including cloud-to-cloud – between cloud-to-local platforms – between the cloud and the environment in place – or a mixture of both. Integration usually involves data and applications, although they can also involve services and systems.\nPerhaps the most common form of cloud integration is data integration, which aims to share or synchronize data between data storage. Another important type of cloud integration is application integration, where two or more applications can share status, requests, commands, and other mechanisms to implement business processes.\nFor example, typical companies use a number of software, such as supply chain management (SCM), enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer relationship management (CRM). Many of these tools are now in the cloud as SaaS applications.\nHowever, this tool cannot generally communicate for data sharing or business policy, which can produce duplicated data and inconsistent business practices. Through application integration, organizations can connect applications to share data and automate broader business practices.\nFor lower levels, organizations can use cloud integration to integrate services and systems to help tasks such as cloud use, cost tracking and problem-solving. For example, emerging system management tools can embrace local resources and cloud, which can help admin understand how resources are allocated and managed throughout the company.\nHow cloud integration works\nThere are no single means to implement cloud integration, but there are several general concepts that need to be considered.\nMediation functions between applications; the cloud integration platform recognizes an event in one application and then triggers a response sent to another connected application.\nFor comparison, federations act as the front end for two or more federated applications where the cloud integration platform can intercept and process events from outside the application and trigger appropriate actions. It is also possible to combine these two approaches so that mediation handles actions between applications and federations handling actions from outside the connected application.\nCloud integration can function asynchronously or simultaneously depending on the communication that occurs. Asynchronous cloud integration communicates data and commands without having to wait for a response from the receiving application. This prevents unnecessary delays in sending – or originating – data because there is no need to wait for the recipient – or target – to respond. Synchronous cloud integration will wait for a response from the recipient application, which ensures the application is fully synchronized before continuing.\nThe actual time needed to do cloud integration can vary. Usually, IT can complete several integration tasks, such as automatic synchronization, quite quickly. Other tasks may require hours or even days, especially if synchronization involves human workflows.\nCloud integration platforms typically use adapters or connectors, which are software modules intended to interact with certain business applications. Thus, the cloud integration platform can implement a central interface or broker that handles security and authentication, while special adapters accommodate integrated applications. Connectors carry out communication and notifications.\nConnectors can be intended for specific applications, such as SAP, or can be vendor neutral, using standard communication protocols, such as simple message protocol (SMTP) exchanges, simple object access protocols (SOAP), application programming interfaces (API) and Java connector architectures ( JCA).\nFor data integration, cloud integration platforms typically use application-independent data formats, such as extensible markup language (XML). Each connector will translate the application specific format to an independent format before making any translation or conversion and then can exchange that general data with the recipient application.\nBenefits and challenges\nEven though cloud integration does not change data or modify applications, it can synchronize data and applications in a company. When properly implemented, integration can automate complex workflows and reduce or eliminate redundant data that can cause operational errors. Consequently, cloud integration can improve operational efficiency, flexibility and scalability, and reduce operational costs.\nHowever, cloud integration poses a number of challenges, most of which stem from a lack of standardization. There is no universal or standard approach to integrating cloud resources. Different applications, resources, and services sometimes use different communication schemes, which make it difficult to create and maintain connectors needed to interact with various cloud elements and the local environment. Updates and patches for applications can change the way the application communicates and may require time-consuming connector updates.\nThere are additional problems that can interfere with the cloud integration project. Because integration can be complicated, they demand technical expertise and, in some cases, dedicated staff to manage.",

The dream was of the early days of the Revolution when his family lived in a small room. His father had disappeared some time before, and the child Winston greedily took all of the chocolate his family—now just his small sister and mother—had been rationed. He ran away from them, and when he returned his family was gone. He tells Julia he had always thought that he murdered his mother.\nJulia comes fully awake when Winston says aloud, \"The proles are human beings. We are not human.\" He believes that emotions make people human, and, because Party members are without emotions, they are already dead. He decides they should part: if she stays clear of him, she can survive. She decides to do whatever he does even if that means rebellion. They decide that, if the Party makes them confess, their feelings will not change. The real betrayal, Winston says, would be to make them stop loving each other. He thinks the Party can't do that.\nWinston's realization of what the Party has done is becoming clearer. He realizes that, in the midst of futilely trying to take care of her kids, his mother exhibited a kind of nobility and had feelings. The Party has robbed the people of feelings and natural impulses. But the proles have retained their natural sympathies. Winston's memory of the time he coldly kicked a severed hand into the street drives home his belief that the proles are the only ones with any feelings.\nWinston believes that the Party will find and kill him. But he knows that, as long as he can hold onto his feelings, they cannot kill his spirit. Winston's sexual relationship with Julia and the practice of writing in his diary—both illegal acts—are what allow him to finally wake up to his internal feelings. He and Julia begin to believe there is a difference between their private space and the public space of the Party and make a promise to continue their love for one another, even if (when) the Party captures them. This is what makes Winston a rebel—his faith in the value of human emotion.",

    "Coal and coal mining – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New ZealandMining. Europeans began mining coal in New Zealand in the 1840s. At first, men went underground and dug out the coal with picks and shovels. In the early 1900s men used compressed-air machines in mines to cut coal from the rock. They also used explosives to blast the rocks. The coal was loaded into railway wagons.The coal rush | New Zealand GeographicCoal. Rangitoto. Gallipoli. Monuments. Subscribe.

    "16 July : Scientists claim to have found that chronic seizures following head injuries may be a result of the brain trying to repair itself, a finding which could prevent some of the most common forms of adult epilepsy.For decades, researchers have focused on neurons as the culprits in seizures, which can actually be characterised as debilitating “electrical storms” in the brain.Now, a team at Colorado University has found that micro-glial cells play a major role in seizures.\nIn fact, the scientists have found that glial cells, which are supportive cells that also constitute a major part of the brain’s immune system, cluster within areas in the brain when a severe brain injury has occurred.\n“When there has been serious damage to the brain, such as a head injury or infection, the immune system is activated and tries to counteract the damage and repair it.\nThese glial cells migrate to the damaged area and release chemicals called ‘cytokines’ that profoundly increase the excitability of the neurons that they are near.\n“In our new study, we showed for the first time that glial cells moving in and secreting these cytokines cause the neurons in the area to become excitable enough to cause seizures,” team leader Prof Daniel Barth said.",
    "As long as anyone can remember, the Choctaw people have had a way of keeping peace and enforcing the law within their nation. These are the Lighthorsemen, a crack team of mounted tribal police who have existed since at least 1800, when the Choctaws lived in Mississippi. When the Choctaws were forcibly relocated to \"Indian Territory in what is now Oklahoma, they brought their law enforcement with them, where it was soon adopted by the other of the Five Civilized Tribes who were moved there with them.\nEach of the five Indian nations (in the original relocation treaties, the tribes were recognized as separate nations from the United States, a ruling that was broken when Oklahoma obtained statehood in 1907) ran their own version of the lighthorsemen, designed to keep peace within the boundaries of their own land. These forces only had authority over people of their own nation, but often assisted law enforcement from other nations, including the United States, by apprehending and detaining suspects until they could be turned over to the right authorities. The organizations of lighthorsemen, and the methods of justice varied some from tribe to tribe.\nThe Cherokee lighthorsemen had an expressed purpose to \"suppress horse thievery and robbery, protect widows and orphans and kill anyone resisting authority\". Cherokee sentences of death were usually carried out via a gallows built in Talequah. The other tribes carried out execution by firing squad, as they believed that the spirit of a man who died by hanging could never leave the scene of his death. Sam Sixkiller was the most famous Cherokee lighthorseman. He successfully stopped the crime spree of Creek freedman Dick Glass who for many years stole horses from Indian Territory, sold them in Texas for large quantities of whiskey, and then returned to Indian lands to sell the whiskey at huge profits. Sam shot and killed Dick and most of his gang in a well planned out ambush.\nThe Seminole lighthorsemen were the smallest bunch in number, but were the most feared due to their aggression. They had no qualms at shooting to kill and carrying out sentences immediately. They had their headquarters at Wewoka and consisted most of the time of only 8 men.\nThe Creek and Chickasaw lighthorsemen were quite similar in size and makeup, except the Creek officers and judge were elected while the Chickasaw force was hired.\nThe Choctaws became a main force in their nation in fighting the flow of liquor to the Indian people. They would hold meetings where a speaker would present whiskey as Miko Homa, or red king, and would tell the audience of the evils that whiskey could bring a man and his family to. Then the people would be asked to sign a pledge to not drink alcohol and to assist the lighthorsemen in keeping it out. Charles LeFlore was the most famous Choctaw Lighthorseman. He had a running battle going with the infamous Dalton Gang, and while he never caught them, he succeed several times in interupting or stopping their holdups.\nIndian Territory in the 1800s was the home of many outlaws. Belle Starr and her gang were known to frequent the area, and indeed one of their favorite hideouts, Robbers' Cave was in the nearby San Bois Mountains. The James Brothers and their gang traveled through the area often. The Dalton Gang and the Doolin Gang passed through Indian Territory frequently. Perhaps because of the reputation of the lighthorsemen, none of these outlaws, with the exception of the Dalton gang ever committed crimes within Indian Territory.\nOne detterence to crime in the lighthorsemens' range is that the policy was often one where the lighthorsemen acted as judge, jury, and executioner. Attempted escapes were not taken lightly, and rarely successful. If a criminal was apprehended and found guilty, the punishment could range from 25 lashings to death by firing squad. A first conviction for rape, for example, demanded the punishment of 50 lashes and the cutting off of the left ear. A second conviction increased the lashes to 100 and called for the removal of the second ear. A third conviction was punished by death. Generally when a person was convicted, the date of punishment was set to be one year from conviction. Very very few Indians failed to appear on the appointed day for their punishment. It was considered a matter of honor and family pride to accept punishment and death without fear.\nToday, the lighthorseman force has been decreased to one. One man, appointed by the chief of the Choctaw tribe serves as a lighthorseman. That man is currently William Williston.",

    "Binangi: A past reconstructed\nBy: Felomina Lisweg- Daskeo\nLong before our ancestors heard of nails and concrete, they were able to construct sturdy houses that could withstand the strongest typhoons with whatever available materials that they could find in the forest, like sticks, lumber, cogon grass and vines. These houses were called “binangi”, others call it gina-on, binatang, or inatep. Such were the houses that dotted our mountainsides as found by the Spanish conquistadores. However, only a few of these houses have withstood the ravages of time and the elements, and the remaining ones are already in an advanced state of deterioration.\nAs part of the celebration of the annual “Ayyoweng di Lambak ed Tadian” then, the municipal government decided to construct a binangi “as a way of valuing our past,” according to Tadian Mayor Anthony Wooden. Indeed, it is but a fitting tribute to a people who have endured and maintained their cultural identity through decades of colonial rule. It is saddening to note though that this so-called cultural identity is already getting frayed and as the years pass by, the ties that bind us to our past are getting cut one thread at a time.\nWe cannot transcend time and go back to the past; we can only reminisce, listen to our elders’ glorious stories, and learn to understand where we came from so that we will not get lost in the present and be able to stay focused in the future. The reconstruction then of the binangi – which was done as close to the original as possible- is more than just a simple replication for nostalgia’s sake, but was meant to educate our generation about this simple structure that embodies a lot of the values and character that defined who we are as Igorots particularly of Western Mountain Province.\nIn the next few years, the binangi at the Tadian municipal grounds might be the last that this generation will see, but it was constructed with the objective that the remaining binangis around the municipality will be preserved if the children will come to understand the indigenous knowledge, systems and practices underlying the building of one. It was only when I took part in the construction of Tadian’s binangi last February 25 that I fully came to understand what the saying “It takes a village to educate a child” means.\nBuilding a house in olden times is a collective effort, so it also takes a village to put up a house. Since everybody in the community is involved, the house and its inhabitants also become the community’s responsibility. You cannot steal from what you own, thus houses were not locked, yet nobody complains of robbery or theft. Materials came from what is available in the forest, so environmental sustainability is emphasized. Nature will provide for our needs, in turn, we also need to protect it. Each becomes his/ her neighbor’s keeper, thus, even the upbringing of the children is not the sole responsibility of the parents.\nThese are but some of the lessons that we teachers- duty- bearers of Indigenous People’s Education- can impart to our children. As the Mayor said, it was put up for educational purposes, and to preserve the knowledge about building a binangi since the keepers of the knowledge are about to kick the dust. It is a noble effort to bridge some of the broken intergenerational ties caused by our “miseducation”. By bridging these gaps, we might again be able revive the spirit of the tribe to guide us as we dig deeper to stay rooted in our cultural identity and still be able to meet head on the challenges of globalization.\nIt takes a village to build a house. Representatives from the different barangays of Tadian and other line agencies came together for the “sukgot” or the roofing of the binangi. Photo by Felomina Daskeo",
    "In the words of longtime Jewish feminist Francine Klagsbrun, “Women's seders have become a phenomenon of our time…From New York to Nebraska, from Berlin to London, thousands of Jewish women throughout the world celebrate the Passover holiday every year with an evening of ceremony and remembrance led by women for women.”\nWhy—and how—a seder primarily for women? What is a “women’s seder”?\nThe timing of a women’s seder—most frequently just before Passover (obviating the need for the food to be strictly kosher for Passover), or on a night during Passover other than the first two evenings (when women might want to be or be expected to be participating in more typical seders with a mixed-gender group of family and friends)—already suggests its position in Jewish ritual life. The women’s seder stands a bit on the margin, critiquing, supplementing, and serving as an implicit commentary on the traditional seder experience with its haggadah text. While for some women this is their most important—or in some cases only—significant connection to Passover, for the most part attendance at a women’s seder serves to add a feminist, woman-centered dimension to the observance of the universally Jewish holiday of Passover.\nIs all this really necessary? Haven’t women become fully integrated as equals into all aspects of Jewish communal life, both religious and secular? Why a separate women’s gathering for this Jewish national celebration?\nTo answer these questions, we need to return to the very beginnings of Jewish national life, to the Exodus story in the Torah. The biblical tale of slavery and redemption is replete with stories of magnificently courageous women playing key roles in the saving and liberation of the Jewish people—and crossing national boundaries as they do it:\n- The midwives, Shifra and Puah, either Hebrew women themselves or Egyptian women attending them, defying Pharoah’s orders and helping male Hebrew babies live\n- Pharoah’s daughter, adopting the baby she saves from the river Nile (did she know he was an Israelite?)\n- Miriam, Moses' sister, first (according to one midrash, or rabbinic legend) ensuring that her parents would reunite and produce her people’s human redeemer, then connecting Pharoah’s daughter with a nursemaid for the baby—Yocheved, his (and Miriam’s) mother\nTo read the biblical story of the Exodus with open eyes is to understand Passover as, among other things, a celebration of women’s heroism. But in the traditional haggadah, women are missing. True, Moses is absent too, and the telling of the biblical story focuses on God’s intervention and liberation, not human agency—but in the many references to human beings throughout the haggadah, it is men and boys who are referred to, and women and girls who are invisible.\nIf it were simply the need for feminist critique that motivated the emergence and persistence of women’s seders, dayeinu—that would be enough. But there is more: the Passover story is, at its core, one of freedom from oppression, from the expectation that one group of people will be subservient to another. It is fundamentally a story of liberation—a story the telling of which feminists not only critique, as above, but also embrace, as elemental to our own journey as Jewish feminists.\nThe first feminist seder was organized by Esther Broner, Marcia Freedman, and Naomi Nimrod in Haifa in 1975, and led to the production of the The Women’s Haggadah, which followed the traditional seder outline but used that structure to speak of Jewish women in our ancient past as well as contemporary Jewish women’s experience. Since then, feminist haggadot have continuously emerged—from the cobbled-together photocopied pages of a group of friends to the professionally published The Journey Continues by Ma’yan, pioneers and leaders in creating and developing large community women’s seders—paying tribute to women past and present, raising feminist questions, re-interpreting familiar rituals and prayers, and articulating a feminist vision of redemptions yet to come.\nWomen’s seders and other Jewish feminist practices in connection with Passover have had their impact on the shape of the seder experience as a whole in many homes and institutions. Already there is a generation of children who would be confused if there were no Miriam’s cup on the table, filled with water (and often paired with Elijah’s cup of wine)—a symbol of redemption and possibility. And in many homes the placement of an orange on the seder plate—whether to represent the importance of women’s full inclusion in Judaism, or to symbolize the need for gay and lesbian equality in Jewish life—is already de rigueur.\nFinally, with so many feminist readings and interpretations available for every element of the haggadah and the seder meal, many family seders benefit from the rich resources that have emerged from the liturgy prepared for women’s seders and from the wider Jewish feminist engagement with Passover. Just as the emergence of the field of women’s history has not let “regular history” off the hook from including women thoroughly in its rendering of the past, so too, women’s seders help infuse other seders with a focus on women as well as men, and with a feminist voice.\nStill, the Jewish feminist journey is far from over—and women’s gatherings are an important part of that journey. With song, with ritual, with story and prayer, Jewish women all over the world gather each Passover to name what is, and to dream of—and works toward—what is yet to be.",
    "How can we and how are we using social media tools for social change? That’s the question that the monthly #4Change chats (that take place on Twitter) address, this month focusing on the Climate Change movement. This was a very lively conversation, filled with examples and experiences from people involved in climate change organizations and campaigns leveraging social media in their work. “Social media is all about moving people up the ladder of engagement” (@JeffM2001) and is designed “to inspire (and to have lasting effect)—build fields and bridges, not brands” (@tropology). These points and the full #4Change conversation are applicable to the Climate Change movement, but also to many social impact sectors and the campaigns reaching around the world.\nSo, what are the biggest lessons for using social media in a global movement?\nThere were three main lessons or focus areas that emerged in the discussion. These three lessons focus on what is successful, unique or important about using social media for the Climate Change movement (or any social impact area). Note: the @names provide links to the Twitter users who made specific comments, just in case you want to connect and continue the conversation!*\nLesson #1: Voice\n“Social media is a storytelling tool, it’s let voices effected by climate change be heard around the world” (@amysampleward). Many social media tools are specifically designed for users to tell stories and voice opinions, others are built as aggregators and distributors of users’ stories. Think about a tool like YouTube, where people can share videos (uploaded and created in various ways from mobile phones to laptop computers to high quality cameras) and then find others who care about similar issues. It is impossible to tell a story about someone else being affected by Climate Change as well as the authentic voice of the person who is living with Climate Change.\n“I’m really interested in how people are starting & joining movements - and how they’re growing via people-powered social media!” (@engagejoe)\nThe power of social media and the authentic storytelling that takes place is in the opportunity for people to inspire other people to take action, which leads to lesson #2.\nLesson #2: Action\n@HildyGottlieb asked a great question, “How many ppl think that by “following” a climate change guru, they’re creating change?” Her question spurred some interesting comments that targeting the idea of taking action. Social media is still the tool or the medium, not the change or the action. The challenge, then, is how to use the tools to effect change, “not just talk about change we want to see one day” (@replyforall). The power of social media in this context, “is in networks growing and collaborating, not silo-ing” (@amysampleward) or “connecting/leveraging/magnifying the work of people who’re already aware” (@HildyGottlieb).\nAnother side of empowering action via social media is to focus on what hooks people in: “Social Media can only inspire ACTION when people EASILY see how their action a) is part of something bigger, b) makes a difference” (@SethHorwitz). “People need choices of action, if they are listening to you they are more than likely interested in your cause / initiative” (@BeverleyPomeroy) so provide opportunities to take action; your supporters are ready! As, @@JeffM2001 explains, “awareness of climate change is already very high, we need to raise awareness about what we can do about it.”\nLesson #3: Local vs Global\nThe final focus area is on the local vs global impact of social media. With tools that let us connect in real-time to anywhere else in the world, it can be hard for us to streamline, focus, or even tell our stories in ways that makes sense to the audience. It especially poses problems for campaigners looking to collaborate around the world and create meaningful opportunities to take action (someone in Taiwan may have a compelling story about Climate Change, but they may not respond or be empowered by a US legislative petition, for example).\n“Real world movement needs to allow 3rd world (biggest victims) to take leadership” (@SethHorwitz.) “The accumulation of climate conscious communities will slowly add to a big pay off. People don’t see ‘big picture’ but relate locally” (@kristianakocis).\nThe local issue also takes the shape of real people, connecting in person. “Social Media can’t be a replacement for getting one-on-one commitments from people—we need faces in the movement, not Facebook newsfeeds” (@replyforall). Linking in global messages or large-scale campaigns to “to offline events and opportunities across organizations/campaigns” (@amysampleward) can bring local communities into the mix and create more ownership for outcomes.\nExamples of Social Media\nThere were many, many examples cited in the discussion. Please follow the links to learn more as I’ve tried to pull out as many as I could:\n- There are many organizations using Twitter to promote actions, including: @350 @1sky @tcktcktck @replyforall @avaaz @PowerShift09 @wiserearth @focusthenation @consequence09\n- Collaborative mapping of climate change policy http://bit.ly/1Jol4U\n- http://climatelab.org is a climate change wiki\n- CoP15 Global Observatory worth a look http://globalobservatory.net\n- Kinda technical, but for any nerds the drupal.org profile of TckTckTck is worth a look http://drupal.org/node/585950\n- #Dreamact -ers have expanded the role of SM, not just to stay connected, but informing supporters on how to use SM themselves\n- 1 way social media inspires action is by making it really easy, e.g. http://consequence09.org/call\n- Pinc is using http://bit.ly/18nurm 2 inspire & inform, evoke w/ built in actions other platforms do similar w/ their applications\n- Climate Ntwks, @1sky @powershift09 @focusthenation & @consequence09 each have own branded window into same 435 groups\n*For transparency: I am @amysampleward in the above chat.\nAmy Sample Ward’s passion for nonprofit technology has lead her to involvement with NTEN, NetSquared, and a host of other organizations.

    "Learning algebra could be difficult for even the brightest of students. The embarrassment that comes from scoring poorly on exams and giving incorrect answers when called on in the classroom can result in power beneath-performance, further discouraging the student and instilling a deep-seated anxiousness about math.\nThere are 4 well known shapes-also called curves or functions in math jargon- that students spend a great time learning in analytic geometry. And confidence is a hundred% the secret in studying any level of Math. Matho combines each bingo and math info in an thrilling timed sport.\nMany schools use math games to reinforce the students studying of the topic and many parents also cater purchase math games software to help their sons or daughters to grasp the topic more. Whereas formulas should yield answers, obsessing over the processes, with out understanding the ideas behind them, would possibly simply make an unprepared pupil panic after they encounter a check question that doesn’t exactly fit the standard mannequin.\nThe concepts are sometimes advanced, and the complicated symbols might seem to be a overseas language – unfamiliar and intimidating; however once college students grasp the basic logic behind the language, solving equations becomes manageable.\nThis game is totally different than Outdated Maid because it’s centered round math ideas. Nice personalities like Johann Bernoulli, Sir Isaac Newton, Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss and so on by no means drained out revolving around numbers and logical ideas because their primary area of study was mathematics.",
    "Polecats Mustela putorius have the typical long Mustelid shape with a creamy under fur overlain by a rich dark brown guard fur. Ear margins are white and the white chin patch extends onto the muzzle and cheeks. The face has a distinctive dark mask around the eyes. There is a big variation between summer and winter coat colour with the lighter under coat more apparent in the winter, which may lead to mistaken identity with its domesticated form, the Ferret Mustela furo (Harris and Yalden, 2008).\nPolecats show sexual dimorphism in size, males being much bigger than females. Body length varies between 450 mm for a large male to 318 mm for a small female, with an additional tail length of between 125 mm and 165 mm. Weight varies from 1930 g for a very large male to 500 g for a small female. In the wild Polecats probably live between four and five years (Harris and Yalden, 2008).\nOpportunistic in their tastes, Polecats take a wide range of prey items, including small mammals, birds, amphibians and fish, with Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus dominating in lowland England. They can be found over a wide range of habitats. Often associated with wetlands and riparian habitats they are also closely associated with rolling mixed countryside and lowland farmland. Areas with hedgerows, stone walls, farm buildings, good prey populations and plenty of cover are favoured. There is a strong relationship with farms and farm buildings in the winter months, for cover and available rodent prey, which may lead to secondary rodenticide poisoning, possibly inhibiting range expansion (Harris and Yalden, 2008).\nIndividual home range characteristics are variable according to season, habitat, prey availability, sex and social status. Breeding females settle into discrete home ranges; breeding males and juveniles are more mobile, with fluid home range boundaries with several den sites in each; Rabbit burrows are often used. Millais (1905) quotes Thomas Farrell, describing the dens of Polecats in northeast Northumberland as having two parts, one part lined for the rearing of young and the other a storehouse for food.\nThe Polecat is a seasonal breeder with one litter per year with between 5-10 kits born usually in May or June. Kits are born in secure dens with Rabbit warrens a favoured location. They are weaned at three weeks and independent between two and three months old (Harris and Yalden, 2008).\nMortality on the roads is often the first indication that Polecats have returned to an area. Their ferocity and smell protect adult Polecats from most predators although they are sometimes killed by dogs and possibly foxes and large birds of prey. Most mortality in the UK is due to humans either through road kill or trapping (Harris and Yalden, 2008).\nThe Polecat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and in 2007 was added to the list of UK Biodiversity Action Plan mammals, protected as species of principal importance for the conservation of biological diversity in England under Section 74 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.\nThe Polecat was formerly more widespread in the UK but now has a much restricted range following persecution in the 19th and early 20th centuries for game preservation. Its past distribution is evidenced by place names such as Foulmart (Polecat) Knowe (hill) and Foumart Law in Northumberland; the old English prefix “foul” referring to the unpleasant powerful scent it emits when frightened or angry. According to Harting (1886), during the Middle Ages Polecat skins were exported under the name of “sable” from Newcastle upon Tyne but there is debate over whether the text refers to importation rather than exportation.\nIt appears in early parish lists as vermin for which bounty was paid, for example in Durham in 1743, Witton Gilbert Parish paid out two shillings and four pence for three foulmarts, and in 1733 Stanhope Parish paid out for six foulmarts, two shillings; two foulmarts, eight pence; and three foulmarts, one shilling.\nMennell and Perkins (1864) state it was then still plentiful in both counties and quote Wallis: “it is found in Northumberland in stony hillocks, in thickets and furze, near villages and farm houses, and is usually called Fou’mart because of its intolerable scent”. In Durham they state that “The Rev. G. C. Abbes tells us that a very fine Polecat visited his garden at Cleadon a few years ago, and was so bold and fearless that it came close to him when gardening, and suffered him to push it back with his rake when it interfered with his work” (possibly a Ferret?). Fawcett (1911) contains text by Thomas Gatiss including: “a Polecat was got in a quarry on Mountsett Fell by a quarryman in 1860 and another was shot on the Pontop Hall estates by Joseph Watson, woodman in 1872 or 1873.” Both of these locations are near Dipton in north Durham. The Victoria History of the County of Durham (Page, 1905) suggests that the animal had only been exterminated from the county in the last 10 or 12 years, suggesting a late 19th-turn of the 20th-century local extinction. Yalden (1999) suggests that by 1915 the Polecat was probably extinct in the northeast of England.\nHowever Bolam (1934) records some late North East Polecats, including a keeper’s tale of Polecats being common enough in a place about 15 miles west of Bishop Auckland around 1901-02 for the keeper to have a large rug made from their skins (one wonders what it smelled like). He quotes Mr George Wright of Fourstones who claimed to have killed three in the autumn of 1917 whilst rabbit trapping at Broken Haugh, near Haydon Bridge. His latest records include one seen on the road at Brunton Bank near Stagshaw, Northumberland, in 1921 and a Polecat killed by a dog at Bishopley Junction in Weardale in December 1919 (Bolam, 1920). He believed this to be one of the last of the indigenous Polecats (due to the pungent smell and the animal’s ferocity), but he does acknowledge the possibility of confusion with the domestic form of the Polecat, the Ferret, in these later records.\nCommonly used for hunting rabbits, Ferrets can exist as feral populations and they can interbreed with Polecats producing a joining of the two forms of the same species, although selection in the wild strongly favours the Polecat phenotype. There are probably therefore many wild Polecats carrying Ferret genes, but because of the close relationship between the two forms and the apparent dominance of the Polecat form, they are not a major threat to the Polecat’s genetic integrity (Johnny Birks, pers. comm. to Terry Coult, 2012). Records of Polecat post-1900 must therefore be tempered with caution as by this time the indigenous Polecat, if still present, was most probably functionally extinct.\nRe-introductions since 1970 have re-established the Polecat in parts of Scotland and England including Cumbria (Harris and Yalden, 2008). The Vincent Wildlife Trust (VWT) has monitored the spread of the Polecat and carried out genetic testing of Polecat corpses in an attempt to understand the spread of the Polecat and the role of the feral Ferret, in Polecat recovery. The Cumbrian population is the most probable source of the recovering Polecat population in the North East but is classed as having relatively low purity due to the abundance of Ferrety hybrids in the population (Birks, 2008). The Northumbria Mammal Group newsletter of Autumn/Winter, 1999-2000 (Gough and Hooton, 2000) records an early record from Lambley in Northumberland, found by Colin Simms in September 1997. A male Polecat killed near Staindrop in south Durham in 1998 (Birks and Kitchener, 1999) was found to be a first generation Polecat/Ferret hybrid and it is likely that many reported North East Polecats carry the Ferret gene.\nUnderstanding of Polecat distribution is therefore clouded by the presence of dark feral Ferret populations and the unregistered reintroduction of Polecats to former parts of its range. Current understanding of distribution probably does not reflect the true distribution of Polecats; it is more likely an indication of limited recorder effort and the very recent interest in the recording of Polecats in the region.\nToday it appears the animal is making a welcome comeback. Kevin O’Hara recalls watching a large Polecat kill a Rabbit beneath Cauldron Snout in Teesdale in the early 1990s, and his recovery of a carcass from the road east of Haydon Bridge in 2004 was confirmed as a Polecat by VWT. Kits (young) have been recorded at Allenbanks in 2010 and at Bardon Mill, Fourstones and Corbridge in 2011.\nBoth Northumberland and Durham Wildlife Trusts continue to get a steady stream of reports and sightings from the region. Some of the more recent records have been photographs of an animal in a live Rabbit trap from Allendale in 2010, and in squirrel traps near Hexham and Haltwhistle in early 2012, and an animal on Waldridge Fell near Chester-le-Street in July 2012. A Ferret rescue centre at Prudhoe has also had several young suspected Polecat orphans which on maturing have been unmanageable and very, very smelly.\nWritten by Terry Coult and Kevin O’Hara (Last updated Nov 12)",
    "David Farragut (1801-70) was an accomplished U.S. naval officer, who received great acclaim for his service to the Union during the American Civil War (1861-65). Farragut commanded the Union blockade of Southern ports, helped capture the the Confederate city of New Orleans and provided support for General Ulysses S. Grant’s siege of Vicksburg. Farragut is best known for his victory at the Battle of Mobile Bay in August 1864, during which he commanded his fleet to ignore Confederate defenses in the harbor, famously proclaiming “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!”\nFarragut was befriended as a youth in New Orleans by Captain (later Commodore) David Porter (of the U.S. Navy), who adopted him. Farragut served under Porter aboard the frigate Essex in the War of 1812; this vessel captured so many British whaling vessels that Farragut, then age 12, was put in charge of one of the prize ships. By the age of 20 he was already an accomplished ship’s officer. In 1823 he served under Porter in a squadron that suppressed pirates in the Caribbean. He was given his first independent command in 1824.\nIn December 1861, after many years of routine service, Farragut was assigned to command the Union blockading squadron in the western Gulf of Mexico with orders to enter the Mississippi River and capture New Orleans, a port through which the South was receiving much of its war supplies from abroad. Although the War Department had recommended that he first reduce the two forts that lay some distance downstream of the city by mortar fire, he successfully carried out his own, bolder plan of running past them with guns blazing in the dark (April 24, 1862). His naval force then destroyed most of the Confederate river squadron that was stationed just upstream of the forts. Troops from Union transports could then land almost under Farragut’s protecting batteries, resulting in the surrender of both forts and city.\nThe following year, when General Ulysses S. Grant was advancing toward Vicksburg, Miss., Farragut greatly aided him by passing the heavy defensive works at Port Hudson below the Red River and stopping Confederate traffic below that tributary. Vicksburg fell in July 1863, and the entire Mississippi River was soon in Federal control.\nFarragut next turned his attention to Mobile Bay, Ala., which was defended by several forts, the largest of which was Fort Morgan. A line of mines (“torpedoes”) on one side of the bay’s channel obliged any attacking ships to pass close to Fort Morgan on the other side of the channel, and the Confederate ironclad Tennessee was also stationed in the bay. Farragut’s force entered the bay in two columns (Aug. 5, 1864), with armoured monitors leading and a fleet of wooden frigates following. When the lead monitor Tecumseh was demolished by a mine, the leading wooden ship Brooklyn stopped in alarm, and the whole line of ships drifted in confusion under the very guns of Fort Morgan. As disaster seemed imminent, Farragut shouted his famous words, “Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!” to the hesitating Brooklyn. He swung his own ship, the Hartford, clear and headed across the mines, which failed to explode. The rest of the fleet followed and anchored above the forts. Then the Tennessee emerged from the shelter of the fort and, after a hard fight during which it was repeatedly rammed, surrendered. The forts were now isolated and surrendered one by one, with Fort Morgan the last to do so. This battle was the capstone of Farragut’s career, but poor health precluded further active service. Having become a rear admiral in 1862 and a vice admiral in 1864, he was made a full admiral in 1866. He went the next year to Europe and paid ceremonial visits to the seaports of the great powers.",
    "My readers are apt to be especially interested in your discussion of creativity in the era of apps. You draw some interesting conclusions by looking at student artworks and how they have evolved over the past few decades. One of the counterintuitive trends you identify is a shift from fantastical subject matter towards more faithful reconstruction of everyday realities. This is surprising to me in part because of the stereotype, which is grounded in some reality, that this is a generation which grew up reading Harry Potter, but some research suggests that schools have tended to have a strong towards realist or at least naturalistic reading, especially in a world where we moved away from the study of literature and towards a focus on deciphering short fragments in preparation for reading comprehension exams. What factors might contribute to this emphasis on realistic rather than fantastical forms of expression? Perhaps the most innovative research in the book entailed the development of detailed coding categories that can be administered, blindly, to works of art and literature produced by young people between 1990 and 2011. The scrupulous application of these codes led to the conclusion that visual art by young people today seems more imaginative than art produced by young people in the early 1990s, while literary productions by today’s cohort are less imaginative, in our sample of creative works.\nThis is a single study and we’d be foolish to draw excessive conclusions one way or the other. We very much hope that other scholars and educators, both in the US and abroad, will make use of these or similar tools and see whether they come up with essentially the same findings.\nWith this disclaimer, we initially shared your surprise about the creative writing findings. It’s not what you’d necessarily expect from youth who grew up immersed in the extremely imaginative world of Harry Potter! But these youth are also growing up in a world of standardized testing, with its pressure to master the perfect five-paragraph essay;and in schools that, with the introduction of Common Core standards, increasingly emphasize nonfiction reading. These trends must certainly have an effect on their use of language.\nOthers have pointed out to us that young people may be more imaginative in the writing that they do online, for friends and in interest-driven communities, than in writing produced for school or for publication. That’s an interesting idea worth pursuing and one that Mimi Ito and colleagues in the Connected Learning Research Network are shedding light on. Of course, we are talking about general trends—no one would claim that there are no young people producing imaginative works. Indeed, perhaps in other areas—ranging from the visual arts to the creation of new businesses—they are more imaginative than peers in earlier eras. And it may even be the case that we come to think differently of creativity in a digitally-suffused era.\nMany of us have argued that contemporary remix practices can encourage certain kinds of critical and creative responses to the culture around them, but you seem to be siding a bit more with Jaron Lanier that such forms of creativity are limited or constrained in so far as they build upon pre-existing cultural materials. Can you explain your position here?\nEarly in their careers, artists are always producing in relation to the works around them and the works that are most valued—either emulating them or consciously rejecting them….or both! We see mash ups, remixing, and sampling with digital media as an extension of an age-old practice of artists. And, like you, we recognize exciting new opportunities for youth to create, share, and receive feedback on their creative productions. Indeed, we observed these opportunities firsthand in our study of young fan fiction authors on LiveJournal. At the same time, perhaps it is easier in an app world than it was before just to keep remixing, with the constraints already present in the current technologies; and if so, perhaps, fewer individuals will go out entirely on a limb.\nTo illustrate the effects of technological constraints on the artistic process, we draw on the work of computer scientist and cultural critic Jaron Lanier. Lanier uses the expression “lock-in” to describe the limited range of actions and experiences open to users when they interact with computer software. As a result of a programmer’s (often arbitrary) design decisions, certain actions are possible—indeed, encouraged—while others don’t even present themselves as options.\nLanier’s primary example of lock-in involves MIDI, a music software program developed in the 1980s to allow musicians to represent musical notes digitally. Because its designer took the keyboard as his model, MIDI’s representation of musical notes doesn’t encompass the textures found in other instruments, such as the cello, flute, or human voice. Lanier argues that something important is lost when one makes explicit and finite an entity that is inherently unfathomable (or, to invoke another lexical contrast, when one seeks to render as digital what is properly seen as analogue). Moreover, since MIDI was an early and popular entrant into the music software industry, subsequent software had to follow its representation of musical notes in order to be compatible with it. As a result, the lock-in was reified. MIDI is a good example of how early design decisions can circumscribe subsequent creative acts.\nDrawing on a well-known distinction within the study of creativity, we have suggested that there may be a new trend at work. In the past, scholars made a distinction between little c creativity (the way that most of us show some originality in how we plan a meal or a holiday) and BIG C creativity (the radical innovations that we value in an Einstein, a Virginia Woolf, a Steve Jobs). Perhaps going forward, there will be more “middle C creativity”—individuals working together online to push the envelope in certain directions, but perhaps less dramatically.\nSteve Jobs is an interesting case-in-point here. On the one hand, he had as much to do with creating the “APP world” as anyone. And yet, Steve Jobs was the least likely person in the world to be constrained by the apps that anyone else had created.\nYou make clear by the end of the book (and now in the new preface) that you are not opposed to all apps. Can you share some of your criteria for judging what constitutes a good or bad app? What are some examples of apps which you think have indeed fostered greater creativity, more exploration of identity, and more prospects for intimacy with others?\nWe’re often asked for examples of apps that are enabling and apps that promote dependence. Our response is that any app can be used in a more enabling or more dependent way depending on what one does with it. Consider the drawing app, Doodle Buddy. In one setting of this app, users select a drawing implement and proceed directly to fill their canvas in a free-form way, much as they would an actual canvas. Another setting in the same app presents the user with an array of pre-fabricated images and backgrounds, which users select and arrange on their canvas in a paint-by-numbers way. In the first setting, users are encouraged to engage the app in an open-ended way, with few constraints imposed on them. In the second setting, users’ actions are highly constrained by the limited range of choices given to them.\nIn our review of various apps, we’ve found that many educational apps lean toward the app-dependent end of the spectrum—drill and kill apps for memorizing times tables, spelling, and state capitals that reward students with virtual smiley faces, candy, or pets that have little or no meaningful connection to the learning task at hand. So, when we judge an app—whether it’s an app used for educational purposes, self-expression, communication, or creative production—we judge it based on the degree to which it encourages users to engage with it in an open-ended way, as non-constrained as possible. Some promising examples of apps that promote open-ended exploration include Minecraft, Scratch, and Digicubes.\nHoward Gardner is Hobbs Professor of Cognition and Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

    "|Forest biodiversity. Illustration: Lisa Larsson\nMore than half of Sweden is covered with forests, and these have been severely affected by forestry during the last 100-150 years, in particular during the last 60 years when systematic clear-cutting and replanting started. The change to young managed production forests and conifer plantations threatens many forest species (see item 2 below). This is important since loss of biodiversity threatens human survival as much as climate change. The problems are also linked: ecosystems with high biodiversity are more resilient to change, that is, they respond better to stress such as a warming climate. For instance, a mixed forest is less susceptible to insect outbreak than a monoculture, and the large variety of mycorrhiza fungi ensures that natural forests store more carbon than plantations. It is important to conserve rare species for ecosystems to thrive in the long run.\nIn a natural forest ecosystem, trees go through their whole life-cycle: they germinate, grow, become old, die and fall over. The dead trunks decay slowly and provide a home to many organisms. Forests consist of different tree-species at different stages of their life-cycles, yielding many ecological niches. In a plantation, all trees are of the same species and age and the trees are felled relatively young, yielding a completely different ecosystem. Some older natural forests have formal protection in Sweden, and forestry operations do take some environmental considerations during harvest, but not enough for all threatened species to survive in the long run. In mountainous regions it can be difficult to prevent changes due to climate warming.\nSome debaters in Sweden deny that there is a serious threat to biodiversity, but ecological researchers and government agencies both agree the threat is real. For instance:\n- About 2000 forest species are red-listed in Sweden according to the Swedish Species Information Centre. They state: \"Three out of four red-listed forest species are declining because of conversion of natural forest with a long continuity to plantations. Swedish forestry methods, in particular clear-cutting, therefore have a strong negative impact on forest species.\"\n- Much research has been done on extinction due to habitat fragmentation, for instance Berglund and co-workers 2005, 2008 och 2009, as well as a Ph.D. thesis from Finland. Important conclusions from these papers are that it is worth protecting even forests without red-listed species because they can be re-colonized, and that woodland key habitats often are too small. Large intact forest areas are needed to preserve biodiversity. Hanski mentions that it is easy to underestimate the risk of extinction. In the future even genetic conservation status needs to be considered.\n- According to the latest official reporting to the EU on the Birds and Habitat Directives, 14 out of 15 important forest habitat types do not have favorable conservation status.\n- The Swedish Forest Agency reported in 2010 about conservation research on how much productive forest needs to be taken out of production to preserve biodiversity. For 17 umbrella species an average of 19% of productive forests would be needed. Umbrella species have specific demands on their environment, and the reasoning is that if these species can survive many others will too. Presently about 4% of productive forests have formal protection and outside the mountainous regions the amount is just 2%. On top of that, 5% of forests is set aside for conservation on a voluntary basis, however the long-term fate of these areas as well as their suitability for conservation purposes is unknown.\n- The Swedish Species Information Centre states: \"Since 1950 about 60% of Sweden's productive forest has been clear-cut and converted to production forests - in many cases plantations. Even before 1950 there have been clear-cuts. Within 20 years all forests outside formally protected areas will be clear-cut as well. At current rates 5% of the productive forest area will be protected and 95% production forests. This large change in land-use implies that biodiversity will be reduced severely, even though new forest reserves are created, and despite voluntary conservation and certifications.\"\nDespite the available knowledge on what needs to be done to protect biodiversity and despite laws (partly based on the EU Birds and Habitat Directives) and a number of international agreements, harmful forestry practices and the felling of forests with high conservation values continues.",
    "Over the last few decades, we have developed a camp for internally displaced people into a vibrant community. Dr. Hawa Abdi and Dr. Deqo Mohamed tell our story in the TED Talk below.\nHistory of Hope Village\n'equal parts mother teresa and rambo'\nDr. Hawa Abdi, the founder of the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation, has been called 'equal parts Mother Teresa and Rambo' by Glamour Magazine. Dr. Hawa showed her tenacity at a young age: she became the first female gynecologist in Somalia, and also obtained a law degree and lectured at Somali National University. Before the start of the civil war in Somalia, Dr. Hawa saw a need for a rural health clinic for women. She opened one on her family's ancestral lands along the Afgooye corridor, on the outskirts of Mogadishu. Dr. Hawa gradually transformed the clinic into a 400-bed hospital. When the war started, families fled to take shelter on Dr. Hawa's land. To preserve camp security and peace during the civil war, Dr. Hawa laid down laws which remain in effect today in Hope Village: she outlawed domestic violence and prohibited the residents from identifying by their clan.\nhope village is born\nSoon, 90,000 people, mostly women and children, had come to Dr. Hawa's land, and most stayed. Dr. Hawa and her daughters, Deqo and Amina, worked around the clock to provide care to displaced and injured Somalis. In the height of the bombing, the hospital saw 500 patients per day. Dr. Hawa and her family did not stop there: they created a camp for the displaced Somalis and built a primary school, high school, community agricultural project, and women’s education center. They renamed the community the Dr. Hawa Abdi Hope Village. In 2008, Dr. Hawa retired from running Hope Village and her daughter, Dr. Deqo Mohamed, took over as CEO of the Dr. Hawa Abdi Foundation.\nIn 2012, there were 90,000 residents living in Hope Village - about one percent of Somalia's overall population - mainly consisting of women, children and the elderly.\nlife in hope village today\nHope Village is now home to about 10,000 people. At the center of the Village is the Dr. Hawa Abdi General Hospital, which has 400 beds and provides vaccinations, along with maternal and pediatric care, to everyone who comes to our doors. The Village's well boasts the only source of free fresh water in the region, and the smart farming agriculture program we are developing aims to give Somalia a defense against famine and climate change. The Waqaf-Dhiblawe Primary School and the Hawa Abdi High School seek to lay the foundation for a new future by educating a new generation of Somali leaders.\nWHAT WE'VE ACHIEVED\nWe have provided free food, healthcare, education, skills training, and hope to more than 100,000 people.\nWe have developed an innovative, autonomous governance and justice system for Hope Village, in which a council of respected community members mediate disputes and investigate crimes.\nWe participated in a national crisis response effort to Somalia's latest drought, and we continue to work with our partners to prevent future crises.\nWe have forged strong relationships with universities, non-profit organizations, individual donors, and members of the Somali diaspora around the world.\nRead our 2018 Program Highlights to learn more about what we have accomplished!\nRead the Full Story\nKeeping Hope Alive, Dr. Hawa Abdi's 2013 memoir, tells the full, incredible story of her life and her record of humanitarian work. The book details the tragedies she experienced that motivated her to become a doctor. It describes the barriers she faced as a woman pursuing careers in medicine and law. It tells the story of when she was kidnapped by radical insurgents in 2010, and much, much more.",
    "What is Separation of Substances?\nMany of the substances that we use every day were once a part of some or the other mixture. Separating substances from mixtures is a vital part of Chemistry and modern industry. This is done to separate the useful substances from a mixture, and also to remove non-useful or harmful components.\nMethods of separation of substances\nFiltration is one of the most common methods used for separating substances. Filters are used everywhere. You use them in your houses to filter impurities from the water and also to filter dust out of the air you breathe.\nDistillation is a technique that uses boiling to separate components of liquid solutions. Different substances in a mixture have different boiling points, and distillation just works on that. For example, if you heat salt water in a container, the water in the solution will boil way before the salt. The water will evaporate leaving behind the salt. When the substances in a solution have similar boiling points, a more complex type of distillation called fractional distillation is used. Crude oil is separated into gasoline, jet-fuel, diesel-fuel, propane and heating oil etc.\nCentrifuges are mechanical devices that revolve at very high speeds and are used to separate substances. At these high speeds, the heavier particles move to the outside of the cylinder and are separated from the mixture. This technique is used for separating blood into plasma and red cells, and also for separating cream from milk.\nIn Threshing process, bunches of crop plants are beaten against a hard thing like a stone or floor to separate the grains from the stalks. When the quantity of grains is small, threshing is done manually, and when it is large, it is either done with the help of animals or machines.\nIn this method, particles of different sizes are run through a sieve which separates them. The bigger particles are retained by the sieve while the smaller ones easily pass through it. All of you would have seen your moms running the prepared tea from the sieve before serving. It is done to separate the tea leaves from the tea.\nIt is the process which uses the wind to separate the lighter particles from the heavier ones. The farmers drop the mixture of wheat and husk from a height. The blowing wind carries the husk with it and the grains fall down on the ground.\nIn a given mixture, the insoluble and heavier particles settle down at the bottom. This process is known as sedimentation. For example, if you dissolve some sand in a glass of water, after some time it will settle down at the bottom of the glass. It happens because sand is insoluble in water and the particles are heavier. Decantation is the removal of the clear layer of the liquid on the top without disturbing the underlying settled solids.\nEvaporation is the process of liquids turning into to a gas or vapor. This technique is used to separate salt from water. Sea water is collected in shallow pits and the water is allowed to evaporate in the heat of the sun. Once the water has evaporated, the salt crystals are left behind in the pit and collected.\nThe process of conversion of water vapor into its liquid form is known as condensation. For example, water vapor in the clouds condenses in form of rain. If you pour cold water in a glass, you will see that water droplets will form on the outer surface of the glass. This is due to the condensation of water vapor present in the atmosphere.\n9. Paper Chromatography\nThis method is mostly used in the food industry for identifying chemicals or coloring agents in different food items. You can think of chromatography as a race; all the runners start together from the starting line but finish the race at the different times because of their different abilities. Similarly, if you drop a mixture at a paper chromatograph, different chemicals in it would travel at different speeds over the chromatograph because of their different chemical properties and get separated from one another.\nMagnetism is ideal for separating mixtures in which one component has magnetic properties. Some metals like iron, nickel and cobalt have magnetic properties whiles gold, silver and aluminum do not.",
    "The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)\nAction on Smoking and Health has been instrumental in the success of the global tobacco control treaty by supporting and serving as the secretariat for the Framework Convention Alliance (FCA) from 2000 – 2015. The FCA is a unique confederation of civil society organizations that includes more than 350 organizations from more than 100 countries. The FCA has been widely recognized by governments, non-governmental organizations and the World Health Organization (WHO) for its vital role in shaping and implementing the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).\nONE BILLION DEATHS: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), that is the number of tobacco-related deaths the world can expect to see in the 21st century. 650 million of the one billion haven’t even been born yet and the majority of these deaths will be in poor countries.\nAdditional Facts from the WHO:\n- Tobacco kills up to half of its users.\n- Tobacco kills nearly six million people each year, including 600,000 nonsmokers who are dying because of their exposure to second-hand smoke.\n- Unless urgent action is taken, the annual death toll could rise to more than eight million by 2030.\nThe tobacco epidemic has been spreading globally through many complex factors with cross-border effects, including trade liberalization; direct foreign investment; global marketing; transnational tobacco advertising; promotion and sponsorship; and the international movement of contraband and counterfeit cigarettes.\nFaced with increasing regulation and greater awareness of smoking-related health risks in many high income countries, the tobacco industry is searching for more markets in low income countries.\nThe tobacco epidemic is a global problem requiring a global solution.\nThe Tobacco Treaty: The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) was the world’s response to the global tobacco epidemic. The FCTC was the first global public health treaty negotiated under the auspices of the WHO. It was completed in 2003, and has now been joined by 180 countries and the European Community.\nWhat the Treaty Requires: The treaty reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health and calls for parties to the convention to:\n- Protect people from tobacco smoke exposure on public transport, indoor work environments and public places;\n- Adopt or maintain taxation policies aimed at reducing tobacco consumption;\n- Enact and undertake comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship;\n- Ban misleading and deceptive terms on cigarette packaging such as “light”, “low-tar” and “mild”;\n- Implement rotating health warnings on tobacco packaging that covers at least 30% (ideally 50% or more) of the display areas – these may include pictures or pictograms; and\n- Combat illicit trade in tobacco products.\nASH was instrumental in the development and adoption of the tobacco treaty, the WHO FCTC, which is grounded in fundamental human rights and freedoms and is a founding member of the Human Rights Tobacco Control Network, an initiative to bring together allies in various fields to focus on tobacco control as a human rights issue.\nPHOTO CAPTION: (June 28, 2004) Ambassador Kim Sam-Hoon, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Korea to the United Nations, signs the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the International Criminal Court.
